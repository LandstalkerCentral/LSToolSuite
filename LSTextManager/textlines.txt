0148=|5A|The treasures of King Nole?|57|Oh, yeah!  I...|59|er...|59||57|have no idea!|5A|
0149=|5A|The bridge has been smashed!|57|The youngsters are planning|57|to make a raid on Gumi.|5A|
014A=|5A|...oh, please....|57|please save my Fara!.....|5A|
014B=|5A|Nigel!|57|I humbly thank you...|57|Thanks for everything!|5A|
014C=|5A|Like the saying goes,|57|"sparkles are the best way to|57|express one's gratitude."|5A|
014D=|5A|The people of Massan|57|are extremely thankful.|57|Please take this jewel, Nigel!|5A|
014E=|5A|Don't forget about us.|5A|
014F=|5A|Are you OK?  Take care!|5A|
0150=|5A|There is a rumor that|57|Gumi is possessed|57|by an evil spirit.|5A|
0151=|5A|I'm all right.|57|Get those monsters first!!|5A|
0152=|5A|Oh, Nigel...sigh...|57|You looked so brave|57|fighting the Orc Kings...|5A|
0153=|5A|If only my father's|57|red jewel were our dowry!|5A|
0154=|5A|Somebody's gotta put|57|those Gumi savages in their|57|place!  If only I were younger....|5A|
0155=|5A|That's it!  That's the last|57|straw!!  I'll do it!!|5A|
0156=|5A|They took Fara|57|into the shrine.|57|We tried to go in, but....|5A|
0157=|5A|the door wouldn't open.|5A|
0158=|5A|I can see now that I was|57|wrong....the tribesmen of|57|Gumi are our brothers.|5A|
0159=|5A|Be careful what you say....|57|my husband is enraged!|5A|
015A=|5A|My husband and son|57|stormed out of the room....|5A|
015B=|5A|I'm so worried!|5A|
015C=|5A|Thank you, Nigel.|57|Now that Massan and Gumi|57|are friends once more,|5A|
015D=|5A|peace and harmony will be|57|restored to our village!|5A|
015E=|5A|Have you met anyone who|57|looks different from us?|58|
015F=|5A|Oh, yeah?|5A|
0160=|5A|Well, be warned!|5A|
0161=|5A|They're Gumi tribesmen,|57|and they don't like us|57|in Massan.|5A|
0162=|5A|Don't go south...you'll|57|get a raw deal!|5A|
0163=|5A|I may be just a kid,|57|but I'm courageous enough|57|to go and beat them!|5A|
0164=|5A|....sob!...sob!....|57|I'm so scared...!  Papa|57|followed them to the shrine...|5A|
0165=|5A|Doesn't Mom look happy, now?|5A|
0166=|5A|"Plant the seeds and|57|watch them GROW!|5A|
0167=|5A|Soon you'll reap what|57|you have SOWN!|5A|
0168=|5A|Take the crops to|57|town one DAY!|5A|
0169=|5A|You'll be rich, and|57|then you'll SAY!..."|57|This is the FARMER'S SONG.|5A|
016A=|5A|My crop sales will boom|57|when I sing it at the market|57|in Mercator.|5A|
016B=|5A|We're elaborating a|57|plan, now.  Don't disturb us!|5A|
016C=|5A|They used something strange|57|to open that door...|5A|
016D=|5A|Listen, Nigel!  I wrote a|57|new song.  It's called|57|THREE GUYS FROM MASSAN:|5A|
016E=|5A|"Three guys bravely go, go,|57|GO!  Three guys boldly.....|57|nice song, huh?|5A|
016F=|5A|Ba-pa-da-da, dee-da|57|GROW!  Soon you'll reap|57|ba-dee-da-DO!|5A|
0170=|5A|Oh!  It's you, Nigel!|5A|
0171=|5A|Thanks for your help the other|57|day.  Why don't you buy|57||5A| directly from the farm!|5A|
0172=|5A|I heard it through the|57|EkeEke vine that Gumi warriors|57|are often seen around the|5A|
0173=|5A|bridge these days...at least,|57|that's what they say.....|5A|
0174=|5A|He...he rushed out of here|57|with the guy next door.|57|He was really enraged!!|5A|
0175=|5A|Hi, Nigel and Friday!|57|How have you been?|5A|
0176=|5A|I've lived here since I was a|57|child...Massan and Gumi were|57|very good friends long ago.|5A|
0177=|5A|What started the feud?|57|Nobody really...|59|I know!|5A|
0178=|5A|Go see the Old Man|57|at the Waterfall Shrine.|57|Maybe he can tell you!|5A|
0179=|5A|It must be an evil curse!|57|Evil haunts us all...|5A|
017A=|5A|At last, Massan and Gumi|57|will attain their former|57|greatness as sister villages!|5A|
017B=|5A|You must go see the|57|Waterfall Shrine Sage.|5A|
017C=|5A|Careful, though...he's|57|eccentric!|5A|
017D=|5A|Brrrrr...|59|...|59|scary!|5A|
017E=|5A|Sob!.....sob!...|57|Is Fara c-coming back?....|5A|
017F=|5A|You did it!  Do you know|57|the saying "DON'T JUDGE A|57|DAHL BY ITS COLOR"?|5A|
0180=|5A|You're a treasure hunter,|57|aren'tcha?|5A|
0181=|5A|Ha, don't even|57|try to hide it!|57|I sensed it at once!|5A|
0182=|5A|Have you met the sage|57|at the Waterfall Shrine?|58|
0183=|5A|Oh, really?  Huh!|57|So you're a thief AND a liar!|5A|
0184=|5A|Ha, ha, ha!|57|You need more experience, kid!|5A|
0185=|5A|Good heavens!  Nice to|57|meet you again, young boy!|5A|
0186=|5A|Oh, the landslide?|57|Yes, well...we seem to have|57|run out of luck!|5A|
0187=|5A|The village was empty, so|57|I searched for some valuables,|57|but there was nothing to take.|5A|
0188=|5A|All I found was|57|some old statue at the|57|mayor's house.|5A|
0189=|5A|There were also some|57|golds lying around,|57|but of course I didn't|5A|
018A=|5A|touch them...|59|...|59|NOT!!!|5A|
018B=|5A|You can't blame me,|57|can you?|5A|
018C=|5A|I know you're the same.|57|You're a thief, too. Ha, ha!|5A|
018D=|5A|We have to move this|57|debris to get to Mercator.|5A|
018E=|5A|You again!|5A|
018F=|5A|Me?  Ah, I came here|57|in search of the treasures,|57|but grew sleepy....|5A|
0190=|5A|They say the trees|57|can be a treasure hunter's|57|best friend...|5A|
0191=|5A|I wonder|57|what that means?.....|5A|
0192=|5A|What a coincidence!|57|How are things going?|57|Me?  Hmmm...so-so!|5A|
0193=|5A|Hey, young man!|57|It's me!|5A|
0194=|5A|Oh, woe is me!|57|I was caught in a strange|57|trap, and...here I am.|5A|
0195=|5A|Well, I've been put in|57|many a jail in my time,|57|but never one that|5A|
0196=|5A|stank like this!|57|I can't stand it!!|5A|
0197=|5A|We have many suspicious|57|guests these days...oh!|57|You ARE a guest here!|5A|
0198=|5A|That strange man flew off|57|like the wind.....|5A|
0199=|5A|You're that hero-boy,|57|aren't you?  Well, any friend|57|of Fara's.....|5A|
019A=|5A|Is...is Miss Friday all right?|5A|
019B=|5A|Nigel!  Friday!  Fara needs|57|our help....but I'm|57|too scared to move!!|5A|
019C=|5A|Friday!  Am I ever glad|57|to see you!|5A|
019D=|5A|I look forward to|57|seeing you again, Friday|57|Oh, and you, too, Nigel...|5A|
019E=|5A|On the west side of Gumi,|57|the road branches off into|57|two paths at the sea.|5A|
019F=|5A|The right path leads to the|57|big town, Mercator.|5A|
01A0=|5A|The left leads to Ryuma,|57|which is famous for its|57|lighthouse.|5A|
01A1=|5A|They will sacrifice Fara|57|to their evil gods!|57|Won't you help?|5A|
01A2=|5A|Gumi is the village|57|just south of us.  They're|57|an atrocious tribe.|5A|
01A3=|5A|I have to stay here and|57|defend this village.|57|It's my responsibility.|5A|
01A4=|5A|Remember, Nigel...|57|the straightest path has|57|many curves.|5A|
01A5=|5A|Hi!  I can give you a|57|helpful hint about a|57|specialty of this island.|5A|
01A6=|5A|Do you know about it?|58|
01A7=|5A|You do?  Oh.|5A|
01A8=|5A|It's a restorative called|57|EkeEke.  It contains a megadose|57|of the Ekenol vitamin.|5A|
01A9=|5A|You can buy it anywhere.|57|Got it?|5A|
01AA=|5A|Fara was kidnapped because|57|she's the cutest among us.|57|Oh, my goodness!|5A|
01AB=|5A|That means I'm next!|57|What should I do!|5A|
01AC=|5A|I heard about your exploits!|57|I know, I know.  It's all|57|thanks to EkeEke, right?|5A|
01AD=|5A|Arf, arf!|5A|
01AE=|5A|Oh!  You can understand me?|57|I'm a girl, or...well,|57|at least I was until|5A|
01AF=|5A|Helga, a witch in the|57|woods east of Mercator,|57|changed me into a dog.|5A|
01B0=|5A|Marty, my sweetheart, is|57|also under her spell.  She's|57|made him into her pet!|5A|
01B1=|5A|Oh, how my heart longs to|57|see him...sigh.....but I|57|can't.  Helga told us|5A|
01B2=|5A|we can never return to our|57|human forms if we meet|57|each other in these figures...|5A|
01B3=|5A|The curse on us will never|57|be lifted unless Helga|57|dies....howoooo!....|5A|
01B4=|5A|Thank you, thank you!|57|Marty and I will make this|57|house our home, now.|5A|
01B5=|5A|I really....yarf!  Arf arf!|5A|
01B6=|5A|Oh, no!  What's happening?|57|Marty and I are|57|changing back again...|5A|
01B7=|5A|Ha, ha, ha!  Just kidding!|57|Good luck!|5A|
01B8=|5A|Cock-cock-a-cock|5A|
01B9=|5A|Cock-co-co-cock|5A|
01BA=|5A|If you see something|57|you want, bring it to the|57|counter and set it down.|5A|
01BB=|5A|It's my duty to make|57|records and perform healings.|57|What do you want?|5A|
01BC=|5A|Bring any book to me.|5A|
01BD=|5A|Is there really a goddess?|5A|
01BE=|5A|If there really is a|57|goddess, why did she let them|57|take Fara?....boo-hoo-hoo!....|5A|
01BF=|5A|Now I know there's a goddess!|5A|
01C0=|5A|Take the note and|57|put it on the counter|57|if you want to stay.|5A|
01C1=|5A|Ooooo!  I'm so angry!|57|Wait'll the mayor hears|57|about THIS!!|5A|
01C2=|5A|I've never met such a|57|courageous man.|57|I really respect you!|5A|
01C3=|5A|I'm still studying|57|the old documents.|57|Could you give me more time?|5A|
01C4=|5A|Is it true that Fara|57|has been kidnapped?|57|Unbelievable...|5A|
01C5=|5A|I think the Gumi tribe is|57|controlled by the Orcs!|57|Fara must be in danger...|5A|
01C6=|5A|Go to the Marsh Shrine|57|and save Fara.|57|Please hurry, Nigel!|5A|
01C7=|5A|Good, good...|57|The two tribes will get close|57|to each other from now on.|5A|
01C8=|5A|About King Nole...I just|57|found out that he did exist|57|in very ancient times.|5A|
01C9=|5A|That's all I can find|57|in my books.  Hopefully, you can|57|find out more in Mercator.....|5A|
01CA=|5A|Hmm, lithograph, eh?...|57|The jewels must belong|57|to King Nole.|5A|
01CB=|5A|According to my records,|57|there are five jewels in all.|57|If the jewels are real.....|5A|
01CC=|5A|Interesting...|57|Come see me again.|5A|
01CD=|5A|Mercator is a big town.|57|You'll have fun there, but...|57|beware of the duke!!...|5A|
01CE=|5A|What?  You're going off|57|to defeat Lord Mir?  Hmmmm...|57|Well, if you must, but....|5A|
01CF=|5A|I still believe he's innocent.|5A|
01D0=|5A|Oh, you actually saw|57|Lord Mir?  Is he all right?...|57|Great!|5A|
01D1=|5A|You can fully trust him.|57|Believe whatever he tells you!|5A|
01D2=|5A|So, the duke finally|57|broke his cover...now everyone|57|will know he's looking for the|5A|
01D3=|5A|treasures of King Nole.|5A|
01D4=|5A|Perhaps your coming|57|here convinced him there was|57|some truth to the legends|5A|
01D5=|5A|after all.....|5A|
01D6=|5A|He has abandoned|57|the town.|5A|
01D7=|5A|He would do|57|anything to find the|57|legendary treasures.|5A|
01D8=|5A|Nigel!  Don't let him get|57|the treasures!  You must|57|stop his foul ambition!|5A|
01D9=|5A|If the duke finds those|57|treasures.....it'll be the|57|end of the world!|5A|
01DA=|5A|Who are you?|57|Get out of here, stranger!|5A|
01DB=|5A|W-we're sorry.|5A|
01DC=|5A|Sorry.|57|Sacred rite.|57|No visitors allowed!|5A|
01DD=|5A|Welcome to the|57|village of Gumi.|5A|
01DE=|5A|Did you know that we were|57|controlled by the monsters|57|they call the Orc Kings?|5A|
01DF=|5A|Actually, I don't remember|57|a thing.|5A|
01E0=|5A|I'm ashamed of myself...|57|We let the monsters control|57|us and profane our most|5A|
01E1=|5A|sacred shrine.  I want to|57|apologize to Massan, too.|57|Will they ever forgive us?|5A|
01E2=|5A|We're going to cooperate|57|with Massan from now on.|5A|
01E3=|5A|Thank you!  Thanks.|5A|
01E4=|5A|Don't be too hard on us.|57|We're really very sorry.....|5A|
01E5=|5A|Get out of here!|57|Get out!|5A|
01E6=|5A|Was I rude before?  Sorry...|57|Remember--you'll get ahead|57|if you put others first.|5A|
01E7=|5A|They say a witch lives|57|near Mercator.  I hear she's|57|very old.|5A|
01E8=|5A|Go away!|5A|
01E9=|5A|Mercator?|57|Exit this village and|57|head west.|5A|
01EA=|5A|I can't go to Mercator|57|because of the landslide.|5A|
01EB=|5A|The road to Mercator|57|is open at last!|5A|
01EC=|5A|Just a minute!|57|We're the emergency repair|57|experts.  This'll only take|5A|
01ED=|5A|a second...|5A|
01EE=|5A|I'm too tired to speak.|57|...Oh, yes, of course!|57|You can go through, now.|5A|
01EF=|5A|Bow-wow!|5A|
01F0=|5A|I like all the folks|57|in this village.  Bow-wow!|5A|
01F1=|5A|Coooooock...cock...|5A|
01F2=|5A|I couldn't go to the|57|shrine with them...|5A|
01F3=|5A|Is it true that you are|57|unbelievably strong?|5A|
01F4=|5A|In that case, stay as|57|long as you like.|5A|
01F5=|5A|It's hard to inspire|57|others to good deeds when|57|so many evils beset us.....|5A|
01F6=|5A|They were possessed?...|57|Oh, my goodness!|5A|
01F7=|5A|We had a big earthquake|57|a few days ago.|57|Natural disasters seem almost|5A|
01F8=|5A|commonplace nowadays....|5A|
01F9=|5A|Ahhh...that was refreshing!|57|Have a nice trip!|5A|
01FA=|5A|Hi, this is Ryuma.|5A|
01FB=|5A|Isn't there a hero|57|somewhere who can|57|help us...?|5A|
01FC=|5A|They say you're a|57|hero, young man!|5A|
01FD=|5A|I saw some blond beauty|57|leaving town with|57|two laughing monsters.....|5A|
01FE=|5A|We suffer many calamities|57|these days.  The lighthouse|57|was vandalized this time.|5A|
01FF=|5A|I bet I could run those|57|thieves out of town|59|.|59|.|59|.|57|if I were older.|5A|
0200=|5A|Father...|5A|
0201=|5A|Why did you go|57|without me?|5A|
0202=|5A|I know you can get the|57||5A|, 'cuz I'm going|57|with you this time!|5A|
0203=|5A|Ryuma is an old town.|5A|
0204=|5A|Believe it or not, this town|57|was much bigger than Mercator|57|a long, long time ago.|5A|
0205=|5A|I heard that Mercator is|57|governed by Duke Mercator now.|5A|
0206=|5A|Was Duke Mercator|57|really such a rogue?|5A|
0207=|5A|You came here to look|57|for the treasures, too?|5A|
0208=|5A|If it's true,|57|I want to have a share.|5A|
0209=|5A|Don't forget to give me|57|a share when you find|57|the treasures!  Ho, ho!|5A|
020A=|5A|Sales are off this|57|month because of the thieves!|5A|
020B=|5A|Leave this place and|57|go back to your home!!|5A|
020C=|5A|You won't regret taking|57|my advice.....|5A|
020D=|5A|Thank you, Nigel.|57|You're the town's very own|57|saviour!|5A|
020E=|5A|Hello, Nigel.|57|Seems we just have one|57|problem after another.|5A|
020F=|5A|Have you seen the|57|lighthouse yet?  Nobody can|57|reach us without the light.|5A|
0210=|5A|Lately, this is a|57|dangerous place!  A gang of|57|thieves has come to this town.|5A|
0211=|5A|I'm packin' my bags!|57|Who wants to live with|57|thieves?|5A|
0212=|5A|Now that the thieves are|57|gone, I think I'll stay here|57|for a while....'Bye now!|5A|
0213=|5A|Oh, are you a visitor?|57|We get so few these days|57|thanks to the thieves.|5A|
0214=|5A|Horrible!!...|5A|
0215=|5A|I look forward to|57|seeing you again.|57|No, really...I mean it!|5A|
0216=|5A|The |5A| was stolen|57|by the apprentice of|57|the lighthouse keeper!|5A|
0217=|5A|Did you know?|5A|
0218=|5A|The shop owner has gone.|57|Where am I supposed to get|57|herbs and such now?|5A|
0219=|5A|They're thieves, but|57|they are still human beings.|57|I must convert them!|5A|
021A=|5A|They must be devils!!...|5A|
021B=|5A|Were they monsters?|57|Really?|5A|
021C=|5A|People are unhappy now.|57|But I'm sure they'll|57|find happiness someday.|5A|
021D=|5A|We live in fear of the|57|thieves who infest the cave|57|on the promontory.|5A|
021E=|5A|Please save our town...|5A|
021F=|5A|You defeated the|57|thieves all by yourself?|57|Unbelievable!!|5A|
0220=|5A|Please restore the light|57|to our lighthouse soon!!|5A|
0221=|5A|You've been most helpful|57|to this town.|5A|
0222=|5A|They're quick to take flight.|57|Chickens!!|5A|
0223=|5A|Mercator soldiers drove them|57|back to the promontory,|57|but they escaped.|5A|
0224=|5A|Won't someone please make|57|those thieves go away?!|5A|
0225=|5A|You're great!|57|How did you ever brave the|57|depths of that cave alone?|5A|
0226=|5A|To get the |5A| is|57|almost impossible!  Tell me|57|who can do it!|5A|
0227=|5A|What!|57|You found the |5A|!|57|Incredible!|5A|
0228=|5A|I thank you from the|57|bottom of my heart!  When you|57|find the treasures.....|5A|
0229=|5A|please buy every item|57|in the shop!  Ha ha ha ha!|5A|
022A=|5A|Sorry...just a little|57|salesman humor!|5A|
022B=|5A|The people of Mercator|57|are also troubled by this|57|business with the lighthouse,|5A|
022C=|5A|aren't they?|57|They're saying the Duke|57|has gone off somewhere...|5A|
022D=|5A|Do you think he|57|went to find a|57|Sun Stone, too?|5A|
022E=|5A|...mumble...|57|my son is out now...|5A|
022F=|5A|...mumble...|57|please avenge my son!|57|...please...!|5A|
0230=|5A|...mumble...mumble...|5A|
0231=|5A|...mumble...I wonder|57|if she's okay...|57|over in Mercator...|5A|
0232=|5A|...is her husband still...|57|collecting jars?...mumble...|5A|
0233=|5A|My dad is out right now.|57|He said he's gotta|57|do something important.|5A|
0234=|5A|Father always told me...|57|..that seamen never cry...|57|....choke!...sob...|5A|
0235=|5A|Ha ha!!  Papa came back!|57|He's very strong, isn't he?|5A|
0236=|5A|Don't blame my dad!|5A|
0237=|5A|He was more shocked than|57|anybody when that apprentice|57|guy stole the Sun Stone.|5A|
0238=|5A|You're way cool!|57|Next to my dad, you're|57|the greatest!|5A|
0239=|5A|Nigel, good timing!  My|57|apprentice has disappeared|57|in all this confusion.|5A|
023A=|5A|Why don't you work here|57|in his place?|58|
023B=|5A|Hahahahaha!|57|Just kidding!  What a|57|good-natured boy you are!|5A|
023C=|5A|That's okay!  The people of|57|Ryuma need your help more|57|than I do.  You're a good boy!|5A|
023D=|5A|My runaway assistant|57|came back suddenly...|5A|
023E=|5A|and took off with|57|the |5A|....|5A|
023F=|5A|The master isn't here now,|57|but maybe I can explain|57|how it works.|5A|
0240=|5A|This lighthouse uses a|57|Sun Stone, the brightest stone|57|in all the land, to guide ships|5A|
0241=|5A|safely to the harbor.|5A|
0242=|5A|M-my...master was|57|killed by the thieves...|57|What should I do???|5A|
0243=|5A|Owwwwww....I'm sorry!...|57|l wouldn'ta done it if I knew|57|it was part of the duke's plot!|5A|
0244=|5A|Owwwoooo.....!!!|57|Please let me go...|57|I'm really sorry...|5A|
0245=|5A|I'm a new person now!|57|I'll work hard under Arthur|57|to right my wicked ways!|5A|
0246=|5A|The thieves must be|57|looking for the same|57|treasures you are.|5A|
0247=|5A|There must be a clue|57|somewhere in the cave!|5A|
0248=|5A|You found the lithograph there?|57|Great!  It must be a clue!|57|Let me see it!|5A|
0249=|5A|What?!|57|It was snatched away?|5A|
024A=|5A|Duke Mercator abandoned his|57|town for the treasures...|5A|
024B=|5A|I guess that means|57|the legendary treasures|57|really exist!|5A|
024C=|5A|Would you mind going out now?|57|We're in a meeting.|5A|
024D=|5A|So you heard us...|57|Well, the mayor went to try to|57|bargain with the thieves...|5A|
024E=|5A|but he never came back.|57|What happened?|5A|
024F=|5A|You saved the town!|57|I can't believe you did it|57|alone!|5A|
0250=|5A|Greenmaze is also known|57|as the "Forest of the Lost."|5A|
0251=|5A|It is said that once you|57|step into the woods...|59|...|57|you never come back out.|5A|
0252=|5A|It's so dangerous that|57|Duke Mercator forbids us|57|to go in.|5A|
0253=|5A|The mayor is out...|5A|
0254=|5A|It's all over for this town|57|if the mayor is killed...|5A|
0255=|5A|It's unanimous!  You're the|57|honorary citizen of Ryuma!|5A|
0256=|5A|What will you do|57|with the treasures?|5A|
0257=|5A|Oh, it's our honorary citizen!|57|We're having a meeting|57|to decide who's going|5A|
0258=|5A|to get the |5A|.|5A|
0259=|5A|Go take a look around town,|57|young man!|5A|
025A=|5A|Young man, you've caught us|57|at a bad time.  I don't know|57|how to put this, but....|5A|
025B=|5A|we've got a problem.|57|Would you do us a favor?|58|
025C=|5A|Quick response!|57|Are you sure?|57|OK!|5A|
025D=|5A|Their hideout is in|57|the cave on the promontory.|57|You can get there by raft.|5A|
025E=|5A|You're right,  I should tell you|57|what I want first.|57|I want you to go to their|5A|
025F=|5A|hideout and wipe them out.|57|Will you do it?|58|
0260=|5A|I'm disappointed in you,|57|boy...|5A|
0261=|5A|I knew you were really|57|something all along!|5A|
0262=|5A|It's quite difficult, but...|57|if anyone can solve Greenmaze,|57|it's you, Nigel.|5A|
0263=|5A|To get to the Sun Stone,|57|you'll need a good sense of|57|balance and excellent|5A|
0264=|5A|jumping skills.|5A|
0265=|5A|Aren't you afraid of|57|thieves?  Go home!|5A|
0266=|5A|I'm hiding 'cause|57|I'm afraid of the thieves.|5A|
0267=|5A|I'm still frightened...|57|Are they gone yet?|5A|
0268=|5A|Another betrayal!|57|I can't trust anyone anymore!|5A|
0269=|5A|Bow-wow!|5A|
026A=|5A|Hmmmmm...I live here because|57|I love the tang of the sea.|5A|
026B=|5A|You can get into Mercator|57|with the |5A|.|5A|
026C=|5A|I think we need|57|an exorcism or something.|5A|
026D=|5A|It's strange...|57|Where is the mayor?|57|What's happening to this town?|5A|
026E=|5A|What on earth|57|do those thieves want?|5A|
026F=|5A|A strange blond woman just|57|snatched my safe-conduct pass!|5A|
0270=|5A|If ya ain't got a|57|safe-conduct pass, ya ain't|57|gettin' in these gates!|5A|
0271=|5A|This is Mercator, where|57|money's the most important|57|thing in the world!|5A|
0272=|5A|Heheheh....|57|Sorry 'bout that.  I'll make|57|it up to you someday.|5A|
0273=|5A|My legs are sore from|57|standing here all day long.|5A|
0274=|5A|Mercator is a historic town.|57|We welcome you.|5A|
0275=|5A|Hello, Nigel!|57|How you doing?|5A|
0276=|5A|Mercator is a|57|beautiful town, great for|57|sightseeing and entertainment.|5A|
0277=|5A|I've just arrived from the|57|continent.  Gosh, what|57|a big town!|5A|
0278=|5A|I heard that Madame|57|Yard's is a great place to|57|rid oneself of stress!|5A|
0279=|5A|Wowie!!  Mercator is|57|wonderful!  I LIKE it!|57|I want to stay here forever!|5A|
027A=|5A|The prices are way too high|57|in this town.  I'm gonna need|57|a lot more money...|5A|
027B=|5A|You're new in town, right?|5A|
027C=|5A|I spent all my money!|57|I have to go home, but I can't|57|afford the trip back!|5A|
027D=|5A|This young fool was the|57|lighthouse keeper's assistant.|57|His master fully trusted him,|5A|
027E=|5A|but he stole the |5A|!|57|He betrayed his master!|5A|
027F=|5A|Young men nowadays lack|57|grit!  They are always taking|57|the short view of things!|5A|
0280=|5A|We are discussing|57|the future of Mercator.|5A|
0281=|5A|I can't believe it!  I spent|57|over 1000 golds on that|57|stupid chicken race!!|5A|
0282=|5A|We almost never get to|57|go inside the castle...|5A|
0283=|5A|The duke is now receiving|57|applications for mercenaries.|5A|
0284=|5A|YOU were invited to the|57|castle?  You must be strong!|57|Can I have your autograph?|5A|
0285=|5A|No, no, don't disturb me!|57|This requires my utmost|57|concentration...|5A|
0286=|5A|What's wrong with you?|57|Go ahead!  Just open the|57|door and go in!|5A|
0287=|5A|How was it?  Not quite|57|what you thought, was it?|5A|
0288=|5A|I said, do not disturb me!|57|Hammana, hammena, hammina...|5A|
0289=|5A|The |5A|!|57|I can see it!|57|Now go and get it!|5A|
028A=|5A|Then the lighthouse|57|will be restored!|5A|
028B=|5A|I think you're smart|57|enough to get through|57|Greenmaze on your own.|5A|
028C=|5A|You got the |5A|!|57|My crystal ball never lies....|5A|
028D=|5A|Please don't disturb|57|me, or I will be forced to|57|turn you into a dog!!|5A|
028E=|5A|Now, where was I?.....|5A|
028F=|5A|I want to be young again.....|5A|
0290=|5A|Hi, cutie!|57|Am I pretty?|57|Am I young? La-la-la!|5A|
0291=|5A|If my mom really becomes|57|young, I can boast to all my|57|friends!|5A|
0292=|5A|I'm happy to see my mom|57|young again, but...|5A|
0293=|5A|Monsters on this island|57|are rare.  They fetch a|57|good price on the continent.|5A|
0294=|5A|I got a ton of golds for|57|the monsters!  I'm going to|57|Greenpea's Playhouse.|5A|
0295=|5A|I caught the three most|57|wanted criminals on this|57|island!  They'll bring in|5A|
0296=|5A|a good price!|5A|
0297=|5A|...grrrrrrrrr...|5A|
0298=|5A|....whoooOOOOoooo!!!......|5A|
0299=|5A|YAAARRRG!!.....|5A|
029A=|5A|Hissssss!!!.....|5A|
029B=|5A|Duke Mercator is a man of|57|fine character.  This|57|comfortable life we lead|5A|
029C=|5A|is all because of him.|57|Hurrah for Duke Mercator!|5A|
029D=|5A|W-wh-what?|57|Duke Mercator deserted us?|57|I don't believe it!|5A|
029E=|5A|Hurrah for General Arthur!|5A|
029F=|5A|I heard that an evil magician|57|to the south of us is a source|57|of great distress to the Duke.|5A|
02A0=|5A|He must be using his magic|57|powers to threaten the Duke|57|into giving him money.|5A|
02A1=|5A|That's why we have to|57|pay a heavy tax...isn't it?|5A|
02A2=|5A|Did you defeat Mir?  Really?|57|Then why the long face?|5A|
02A3=|5A|Where will we be|57|without Duke Mercator?|5A|
02A4=|5A|General Arthur lowered|57|the tax rate.|57|He's quite a guy!|5A|
02A5=|5A|Welcome to Mr. Ludwig's.|57|If you came for a|57|music lesson,|5A|
02A6=|5A|Mr. Ludwig is out.....|5A|
02A7=|5A|Ludwig is not here!|57|I'm afraid It'll be some time|57|before he returns.|5A|
02A8=|5A|Did you come here to listen|57|to him play, too?  I came|57|all the way from the continent|5A|
02A9=|5A|just to hear our very own|57|national treasure play...|57|where is he?|5A|
02AA=|5A|What a pity!  I was looking|57|forward to listening to that|57|beautiful sound of his.|5A|
02AB=|5A|I'm going back to the|57|continent.  There's no sense|57|in waiting any longer|5A|
02AC=|5A|for this Ludwig character.|57|What?  The lighthouse is|57|out of order?|5A|
02AD=|5A|Gee!|57|Of all the rotten luck!!!|5A|
02AE=|5A|I'm going back home.|57|Looks like I'll never get to|57|hear him play, now.|5A|
02AF=|5A|Hurry, hurry!!|57|Step right up!|57|We're almost out of stock!|5A|
02B0=|5A|There's none cheaper!|57|Low-price guarantee...|57|...every day!!|5A|
02B1=|5A|This shop is famous|57|even on the continent.  I have|57|a huge shopping list for|5A|
02B2=|5A|all my friends.....|5A|
02B3=|5A|This shop is always crowded|57|because it's cheaper than|57|that other shop over there.|5A|
02B4=|5A|What a fool!|57|I bought too many!|5A|
02B5=|5A|If you're not a registered|57|member, don't waste my time.|57|Scram!  Beat it!!|5A|
02B6=|5A|You again!|57|I said members only!|57|Now, out!  Out!|5A|
02B7=|5A|Please...go on upstairs.|5A|
02B8=|5A|What a stubborn kid!|57|Do you want to make me angry?|57|Get out of here!|5A|
02B9=|5A|You're too young for|57|Madame Yard's.  I'm sorry.|5A|
02BA=|5A|Please come again|57|when you've grown up.|5A|
02BB=|5A|Curious boy!|57|You know, curiosity is a|57|necessity for greatness.....|5A|
02BC=|5A|Hello, kind sir.  To become|57|a member at Madame Yard's,|57|please ask at the counter.|5A|
02BD=|5A|Say hello to Miss Shorty--|57|er, I mean, Miss Friday!|5A|
02BE=|5A|Non-members can't|57|go upstairs.  Sorry.|5A|
02BF=|5A|OK, listen carefully.|57|This is a popular trick|57|among the young boys...|5A|
02C0=|5A|Go and see the Fortuneteller.|57|I'm sure you'll be|57|pleasantly surprised!|5A|
02C1=|5A|Welcome to Madame Yard's!|57|She's the very best!!|5A|
02C2=|5A|Hardships are essential|57|for you to mature.|5A|
02C3=|5A|There really are no|57|easy solutions.....|5A|
02C4=|5A|Quite expensive, but I feel|57|much better!  I've got to go|57|home now and...|5A|
02C5=|5A|practice what I learned...|5A|
02C6=|5A|Duke Mercator asked him|57|to steal the |5A| for|57|six golds!  Six!!|5A|
02C7=|5A|I've just about dislocated|57|my jaw from talking so much.|5A|
02C8=|5A|I want them to lower|57|our taxes!|5A|
02C9=|5A|My favorite game is|57|roulette!  Let's go win|57|a bundle on it!|5A|
02CA=|5A|Me?  Yes, I'm a|57|member, but I don't wear|57|my tutu when I'm off.|5A|
02CB=|5A|I've been waiting all week|57|for a session with|57|Madame Yard!|5A|
02CC=|5A|If only I could afford to|57|come here more often.....|5A|
02CD=|5A|...sigh....The shop is|57|closed now.  But you can|57|see that.....|5A|
02CE=|5A|As you know, there's another|57|shop just across the way.|57|Both of us sell|5A|
02CF=|5A|the same items, but they|57|sell them much cheaper.|57|I'm thinking of changing|5A|
02D0=|5A|my job, but I don't know what|57|kind of shop I'd be most|57|suitable for.....|5A|
02D1=|5A|I don't even want to|57|get out of bed, I'm|57|such a failure!.....|5A|
02D2=|5A|I want to open a new shop...|57|...sigh...what should I do?...|5A|
02D3=|5A|Nigel, how have you been?|57|I've been thinking hard about|57|starting over,|5A|
02D4=|5A|making a new life....and I|57|finally made up my mind|57|to change my job!|5A|
02D5=|5A|Would you give me|57|your opinion?|58|
02D6=|5A|Yeah, I know that you're|57|busy.  Visit me later when|57|you have nothing better to do.|5A|
02D7=|5A|How about a drugstore?|58|
02D8=|5A|Hmmm....okay, then,|57|how about a variety shop?|58|
02D9=|5A|Well, I've got the list of|57|possibilities narrowed down|57|to these two.  So......|5A|
02DA=|5A|choose between the two.|57|I'll follow your advice.|5A|
02DB=|5A|Now, let's try once more.|5A|
02DC=|5A|You agree?  Great!!|57|It looks like I'm a drugstore|57|owner from now on!|5A|
02DD=|5A|You agree?  Then it's|57|settled!  I'm a variety shop|57|owner from now on!|5A|
02DE=|5A|By the way, would you|57|do me a favor?|57|I'd like you to go to the|5A|
02DF=|5A|wholesale market at the|57|Mercator port warehouse.|57|It opens when the ship from|5A|
02E0=|5A|the continent docks here.|57|Please go to the market and|57|pick up the goods for me.|5A|
02E1=|5A|I'll stay here and fix things|57|up.  Bring this with you.|57|It's a Buyers' Guild card.|5A|
02E2=|5A|Did you go to the market?|5A|
02E3=|5A|I received the goods, and I'm|57|doing quite well these days!|5A|
02E4=|5A|I'm happy with my new|57|shop!  This is the turning|57|point of my life!|5A|
02E5=|5A|I owe it all to you, Nigel!|5A|
02E6=|5A|In return, I'd like to offer you|57|my bargain basement prices!|5A|
02E7=|5A|Drop by anytime!|5A|
02E8=|5A|We have a large stock|57|of unusual things!|5A|
02E9=|5A|Was the market already|57|closed?  That's okay.|57|They'll open it up again.|5A|
02EA=|5A|I'll just stay here and|57|get things ready so I can|57|go for myself next month.|5A|
02EB=|5A|Dad should have checked|57|around town before|57|opening this shop...|5A|
02EC=|5A|My dad is thinking of|57|changing his job.|5A|
02ED=|5A|I'm a drugstore owner's son|57|from now on!  Wow!|5A|
02EE=|5A|I'm a variety shop owner's|57|son from now on! Wow!|5A|
02EF=|5A|My dad is a great shopkeeper.|57|I love him.|5A|
02F0=|5A|How do you do?  I'm June,|57|Fahl's fair girlfriend.|5A|
02F1=|5A|It's quite embarrassing!  My son|57|goes to Madame.....Lard's|57|or something almost everyday!|5A|
02F2=|5A|I just can't understand him!|57|Is it such a great place?|5A|
02F3=|5A|Mir lives in that old tower,|57|but I hear he was in town|57|long before the duke.|5A|
02F4=|5A|Apparently, the duke expelled|57|him from Mercator because of|57|some hideous crime.....|5A|
02F5=|5A|Mir lives in that old tower,|57|but I hear he was in town|57|long before the duke.|5A|
02F6=|5A|Apparently, the duke expelled him|57|frome Mercator because of|57|some hideous crime.....|5A|
02F7=|5A|Oh, I don't know if it's|57|true or not.  I just|57|heard it from a friend.|5A|
02F8=|5A|The |5A| is a|57|precious ore.  It's only found|57|in the depths of Greenmaze.|5A|
02F9=|5A|I haven't heard a thing|58|rom my relatives in Verla|57|for a while, now.....|5A|
02FA=|5A|I heard that Duke Mercator|57|brought nothing but trouble|57|to Verla as well.|5A|
02FB=|5A|If General Arthur had been|57|killed, Mercator would be|57|a ghost town, now!|5A|
02FC=|5A|I disagree with him.|57|I think Madame Yard's|57|is a nice place.|5A|
02FD=|5A|It's impossible to enter|57|Mir's tower because of|57|the barrier at the door...|5A|
02FE=|5A|...Oh, it's you...|5A|
02FF=|5A|Greenmaze is to the north|57|of the castle.  Many tourists|57|are reported missing there|5A|
0300=|5A|each year, so the duke|57|prohibited all entry|57|into Greenmaze.|5A|
0301=|5A|Duke Mercator is crazy with|57|greed over those treasures.|57|Are they really so valuable?|5A|
0302=|5A|I'm quite satisfied with|57|General Arthur's|57|administration.|5A|
0303=|5A|I saw a great beauty|57|walking along the street.|57|Her two attendants were...|5A|
0304=|5A|....can you guess?|57|They were monsters!|5A|
0305=|5A|Are you going to defeat|57|the magician in the tower?|5A|
0306=|5A|Wow!|57|You came back alive!|5A|
0307=|5A|But the lighthouse cannot|57|exist without the |5A|!|57|Who would do such a thing?|5A|
0308=|5A|If the tunnel between Verla|57|and Mercator could be|57|re-opened, Verla would be just|5A|
0309=|5A|a step away.  But a recent|57|earthquake blocked up the|57|tunnel.  So you can only|5A|
030A=|5A|get to Verla by sea, now.....|5A|
030B=|5A|One of my relatives|57|runs a shop in Verla.|5A|
030C=|5A|General Arthur struggled|57|with the Duke to the last.|5A|
030D=|5A|Would you like a fruit drink?|57|How about my Dahl Delight?|5A|
030E=|5A|It's the choice of a|57|new generation!|5A|
030F=|5A|Duke Mercator is now|57|recruiting mercenaries to|57|mount an attack against Mir.|5A|
0310=|5A|They're having a victory|57|celebration in advance.|5A|
0311=|5A|Nigel!|57|Is it true you defeated Mir?|5A|
0312=|5A|Duke Mercator ran out on|57|the town!  What a surprise!|5A|
0313=|5A|What are we going to do|57|now?|5A|
0314=|5A|I've remodeled!|57|You can order from upstairs|57|and not even get out of bed!|5A|
0315=|5A|Go upstairs and|57|order something.|5A|
0316=|5A|Where is she?...sigh!...|57|...where is she now...|57|oh!  Are you a tourist?|5A|
0317=|5A|Will you hear my story?|58|
0318=|5A|Needless to say, I'm Ludwig,|57|the world-famous composer|57|from the continent.|5A|
0319=|5A|Princess Lara came here|57|to study under me, but then...|5A|
031A=|5A|she just vanished!!|57|I'm afraid my lessons weren't|57|good enough for her...|5A|
031B=|5A|She might at least say|57|good-bye before leaving...|57|Sigh!...how cute she was....|5A|
031C=|5A|Oh, please listen....|58|
031D=|5A|I felt a bit sick, so I|57|came out here.  Princess|57|Lara?  Well, she's...|5A|
031E=|5A|Particular...yes, particular!|57|Actually, she's|57|very hard to deal with.|5A|
031F=|5A|Perhaps her fussiness|57|irritated the Duke so much|57|he sent her back home.....|5A|
0320=|5A|That Ludwig is a bit of a sap!|57|I think he's out of his head|57|over this princess babe....|5A|
0321=|5A|Ludwig?  After returning|57|from the castle, he guzzled|5A|
0322=|5A|six Diet Dahls.  Six!  Then|57|he became unruly, so I|57|had to throw him out.|5A|
0323=|5A|How sensitive that Ludwig is!|57|He seemed so shocked when|57|I asked him to leave.|5A|
0324=|5A|Now he's gone off|57|somewhere, probably to|57|lick his wounds.....|5A|
0325=|5A|These artist types sure|57|are hard to understand.|5A|
0326=|5A|General Arthur's alive!|57|Happy, happy!  Joy!  Joy!|57|Let's party!|5A|
0327=|5A|Huzzah!  Huzzah!  Let's hear|57|it for lower taxes!  Look out,|57|Mir, I'm comin' to getcha!|5A|
0328=|5A|TOGA!  TOGA!  TOGA!|57|Hey, you!  Barkeep!  Another|57|round of Dahl Delights!|5A|
0329=|5A|Are the taxes lowered yet?|57|Did they get that Mir guy?|57|Who cares?  Let's party!!|5A|
032A=|5A|Have you been to the|57|casino yet?  It's exciting!|5A|
032B=|5A|The men in this town|57|seem to be falling|57|head over heels|5A|
032C=|5A|for some new cutie|57|from the continent.....|5A|
032D=|5A|Welcome back, hero!|57|...but...why so troubled?|57|Anything wrong?|5A|
032E=|5A|Is the rumor about the|57|Duke true?  If so, he must|57|really be a wicked man!|5A|
032F=|5A|He was always smiling and|57|pretending to serve the town.|5A|
0330=|5A|General Arthur and his|57|new casino are the|57|talk of the town now.|5A|
0331=|5A|Take it from me, kid!|57|Never, never, NEVER give|57|your heart to a girl!!|5A|
0332=|5A|Ah, Princess......|57|Zzzzzzzz.....|5A|
0333=|5A|I...feel sick...|57|to my stomach......|5A|
0334=|5A|Not only do I feel sick|57|to my stomach, I think|57|I sprained my ankle.....!|5A|
0335=|5A|Zzzzz...|57|Julie.....|5A|
0336=|5A|Duke Mercator is originally|57|from the continent, so he|57|often invites guests from his|5A|
0337=|5A|homeland.  Just recently, a|57|noble girl named Lara came|5A|
0338=|5A|to study piano.  I haven't|57|seen her around, lately, so|57|maybe she went home.....|5A|
0339=|5A|I heard about you!  You're|57|one of those mercenary|57|fellas who're going off to|5A|
033A=|5A|defeat Mir and restore the|57|peace!  We're expecting much|57|from you!  Waste that wizard!|5A|
033B=|5A|Hey, hero!  How'd the|57|fight against Mir go?|57|Are you OK?|5A|
033C=|5A|If the terrible rumor|57|about the Duke is true, it|57|must be a lie that it was Mir|5A|
033D=|5A|who caused the heavy tax.|5A|
033E=|5A|Our family has been serving|57|the castle for generations.|57|Now my son is a cook, and|5A|
033F=|5A|my daughter is a maid.|57|They work for Duke Mercator.|57|You envy them, right?|5A|
0340=|5A|My son told me that|57|you're going to the tower.|57|They say the tower|5A|
0341=|5A|is full of traps and snares.|57|Please be careful!....|5A|
0342=|5A|Oh, Nigel!|57|You came back from the tower!|57|Amazing!|5A|
0343=|5A|What a fool!|5A|
0344=|5A|Do you know the|57|importance of the|57||5A|?|5A|
0345=|5A|Go to Greenmaze and|57|find the |5A||57|by yourself!|5A|
0346=|5A|Finally he's seen the light!|57|We've been preaching to him|57|for six hours!|5A|
0347=|5A|Have you heard about|57|General Arthur?|58|
0348=|5A|He's in charge of the|57|castle guard, now.  He's still|57|worried about the Duke's plot.|5A|
0349=|5A|He was seriously injured...|57|Now he's under|57|strict medical care.|5A|
034A=|5A|I think General Arthur is|57|worthy of becoming|57|Mercator's next ruler.|5A|
034B=|5A|That Arthur is quite an|57|able statesman!  He opened|57|a casino to help lower taxes!|5A|
034C=|5A|Heh, heh, heh...You'd better|57|leave....this place isn't for|57|sightseers.....heh, heh, heh...|5A|
034D=|5A|Ah, welcome...to the|57|Mercator Champion Motel!|57|Heros check in, but they|5A|
034E=|5A|don't check out!.....|5A|
034F=|5A|Well, heh heh...there it is,|57|the underground crypt.|57|What're you waiting for?...|5A|
0350=|5A|Both in this world and|57|the one below...heh heh heh...|57|you have to use your brain.|5A|
0351=|5A|Heh heh, it was|57|good practice for you,|57|wasn't it?...heh heh...|5A|
0352=|5A|Stand in front of the|57|counter, jump and throw|5A|
0353=|5A|It may be a little difficult,|57|but you'll get the hang of it!|5A|
0354=|5A|Ba-pa-da-da, dee-da|57|GROW!  Soon you'll reap|57|ba-dee-da-do.....|5A|
0355=|5A|Mom likes to sing!|5A|
0356=|5A|Weigh anchors, weigh, yo-ho,|57|Waves breaking, weigh yo-ho|57|Hey-hey!  I'll teach mom|5A|
0357=|5A|a new song!|5A|
0358=|5A|I don't know who's been|57|teaching him, but my son|57|likes to sing strange songs...|5A|
0359=|5A|Ba-pa-da-da, dee-da|57|GROW!  Soon you'll reap|57|ba-dee-da-do......I like it!|5A|
035A=|5A|I'm a guard at the castle,|57|but I'm off duty today!|57|I'm going to Greenpea's!|5A|
035B=|5A|It's said that the|57|underground monsters are much|57|more cunning than us!|5A|
035C=|5A|We wish you good luck!|57|While you're at it|59|...|59|...can you|57|get the taxes lowered?|5A|
035D=|5A|I used to work at|57|the castle in my younger days.|5A|
035E=|5A|We almost never get invited|57|to the castle.  But I carry|57|with me the memory|5A|
035F=|5A|of its elegance...|5A|
0360=|5A|The ship arrived from the|57|continent!  Let's go to the|57|monthly market!|5A|
0361=|5A|Y'know, the rumor must be|57|true.  When my husband went|57|to Ryuma, he saw a young man|5A|
0362=|5A|casting the |5A| away.|57|It was the lighthouse keeper's|57|apprentice.  He questioned|5A|
0363=|5A|the boy and found that|57|Duke Mercator duped him into|57|stealing the Sun Stone!|5A|
0364=|5A|On hearing that, my husband|57|came back in a hurry, but|57|the duke had already gone...|5A|
0365=|5A|The interrogation is still|57|going on upstairs.|5A|
0366=|5A|They're still upstairs,|57|trying to set that young man|57|straight.  We have to prepare|5A|
0367=|5A|for the future.....|5A|
0368=|5A|Remember the lighthouse|57|apprentice?  He's working|57|under General Arthur, now!|5A|
0369=|5A|My friend works at the|57|castle, see,  and he says|57|there's a labyrinth in the|5A|
036A=|5A|basement.  And that's not all!|57|It's fulla creepy monsters,|57|too!  Yuckk!  Disgusting!|5A|
036B=|5A|My friend also said that|57|rogues and criminals are|57|being held prisoner in the|5A|
036C=|5A|castle's underground prisons!!|57|Whaddaya think of that?!|5A|
036D=|5A|Pop and the others are|57|upstairs grilling the|57|apprentice.  He's the one who|5A|
036E=|5A|broke into the lighthouse.|5A|
036F=|5A|Yeah, they're still upstairs.|57|I think he's had enough.....|5A|
0370=|5A|Somebody must take over|57|at the castle to keep order|57|in this town!|5A|
0371=|5A|My dad and his friends|57|are upstairs discussing|57|the new casino.|5A|
0372=|5A|A traditional town,|57|Mercator.  You have to behave|57|properly here.|5A|
0373=|5A|I hope the evil magician|57|is defeated soon...and|57|our taxes get lowered.....|5A|
0374=|5A|Duke Mercator is a kind|57|and friendly man.  He came|57|downtown the other day and|5A|
0375=|5A|spoke to each of us in|57|person.  I was|57|deeply impressed.|5A|
0376=|5A|Duke Mercator is|57|WONderful!  He looks so|57|gentle, mild, and refined.|5A|
0377=|5A|Duke Mercator is|57|WONderful!  He looks so|57|gentle, mild, and refined.|5A|
0378=|5A|Hello, sir!|57|Don't you look nice.....|5A|
0379=|5A|Well?  How was it?|57|You saw Duke Mercator, right?|57|I envy you!|5A|
037A=|5A|Well?  How'd it go?|57|You saw Mir, right?  Was he|57|as strong as they say?|5A|
037B=|5A|What?  Duke Mercator was|57|really a wicked man?...Oh,|57|I saw him going to port|5A|
037C=|5A|with his soldiers|57|just a little while ago...|57|What's going on?|5A|
037D=|5A|The duke was really one of|57|the bad guys?  I should have|57|listened to you before.....|5A|
037E=|5A|We're getting used to|57|life without Duke Mercator.|57|What on earth could he be|5A|
037F=|5A|doing now?  What?  He's|57|still looking for the|57|treasures?  Hmmm.....!|5A|
0380=|5A|This fortuneteller is famous|57|around here.  She can cast an|57|awesome spell on us!|5A|
0381=|5A|Heh heh...I know, I know.|57|You asked her to cast a spell|57|upon you, didn't you?|5A|
0382=|5A|Well, go ahead!  Madame|57|Yard's is just across the way.|5A|
0383=|5A|Her sorcery is so famous that|57|many people come all the way|57|from the mainland to see her.|5A|
0384=|5A|How come a doghouse occupies|57|the best place in the town?|57|I just don't understand!|5A|
0385=|5A|Well, I want to buy this|57|estate, but...is this dog|57|going to sell, or what?|5A|
0386=|5A|Who actually owns this|57|estate, anyway?...|57|Duke Mercator, perhaps?.....|5A|
0387=|5A|Did you know the duke|57|has fled?  Where will we be|57|without him?|5A|
0388=|5A|See the sign?|5A|
0389=|5A|Now's my chance...|57|I've got the best plot of land|57|in all of Mercator!|5A|
038A=|5A|Rats!  I've got the land,|57|but...now I have no money|57|to build a house on it!|5A|
038B=|5A|Mercator Harbor is to the|57|south.  We have a regular|57|liner from the continent.|5A|
038C=|5A|Our supply of goods will|57|flourish when the ship|57|arrives.|5A|
038D=|5A|Good heavens!  The ship|57|can't leave because of the|57|trouble with the lighthouse!|5A|
038E=|5A|Good heavens!  The ship|57|can't leave because of the|57|trouble with the lighthouse!|5A|
038F=|5A|Good heavens, the.....oh!|57|You fixed it?|57|Great!|5A|
0390=|5A|Did you hear about the new|57|casino that opened recently?|57|It's an exciting place!|5A|
0391=|5A|I often watch the officers|57|of the castle go in and out.|57|What do they do inside...?|5A|
0392=|5A|When I grow up, I'll be a|57|member of the Royal Guard|57|and serve Duke Mercator.|5A|
0393=|5A|Are you really going|57|to the Tower of Mir?  Are you|57|tired of living, or what?!!|5A|
0394=|5A|Welcome back!|57|We thought you were dead!|5A|
0395=|5A|I'm watching for invaders|57|from the tower.|5A|
0396=|5A|Bow-wow!  Bow-wow!|5A|
0397=|5A|I didn't mean to take|57|the best spot in town!.....|5A|
0398=|5A|I can tell you're a|57|real ladykiller...|5A|
0399=|5A|Mom's work is almost|57|over for the day.|5A|
039A=|5A|Madame Yard is my mom.|57|She'll be closing up for the|57|day, soon.  I bet she's tired!|5A|
039B=|5A|Mom and I are going to the|57|continent to open up a new|57|franchise.  Please stop by!|5A|
039C=|5A|What?  Oh, you can|57|see what our business is|57|when you come!|5A|
039D=|5A|Please fix the lighthouse|57|for my mom and me!|5A|
039E=|5A|I've never been to the|57|continent before.  I was born|57|and raised on this island.|5A|
039F=|5A|I was robbed!|57|That Greenpea's...|57|Absolutely robbed!|5A|
03A0=|5A|I'm a corpse!  My wife'll kill|57|me!  How'm I gonna...I know!|57|I'll say I lost my wallet.....|5A|
03A1=|5A|I want to enjoy life|57|once again!  I'll ask her to|57|cast a spell on me!|5A|
03A2=|5A|I'm young!|57|I'm young again!|57|Hurray!|5A|
03A3=|5A|Oh, Fahl my love,|57|When will you see me?|57|I'm always thinking of you.|5A|
03A4=|5A|See?  See!|57|What is that girl doing in|57|his room!  I can't stand it!|5A|
03A5=|5A|Hear that?  Fahl has been|57|talking with that girl|57|all night long...!|5A|
03A6=|5A|I'm getting jealous...!|5A|
03A7=|5A|I think it's time I|57|gave him up...|5A|
03A8=|5A|Mr. Fahl has many fans.|57|I'll admit he's strong and|57|tough, but......|5A|
03A9=|5A|he's so old!  Why do|57|the girls all go for him?|5A|
03AA=|5A|I'm not sure when the|57|next ship comes.....|5A|
03AB=|5A|I just heard some horrible|57|screams....are my ears|57|playing tricks on me?|5A|
03AC=|5A|To tell the truth,|57|I'm a soldier from the castle.|57|It's my duty to stand guard|5A|
03AD=|5A|here in disguise.|57|I'm proud of this job!|5A|
03AE=|5A|You're going to the|57|tower too?|57|How bold you guys are!|5A|
03AF=|5A|I don't know why, but|57|chills run up and down my|57|spine every time I'm|5A|
03B0=|5A|near this place....Brrr!|5A|
03B1=|5A|Zak and Dexter?|57|They went down to the|57|crypt some time ago.|5A|
03B2=|5A|Hi!  You're another|57|treasure hunter, aren't you?|57|We seem to get a lot of them|5A|
03B3=|5A|here lately.....|5A|
03B4=|5A|Wh...Who are you!|57|I'm busy.  Dont bother me!|5A|
03B5=|5A|This is the castle of|57|Mercator.|57|I cannot allow you inside.|5A|
03B6=|5A|Mr. Nigel!  General Arthur|57|told us to let you go in.|57|Please go ahead.|5A|
03B7=|5A|I'd like to come along and|57|help, but standing here is|57|an important duty!|5A|
03B8=|5A|Company--salute!|57|Do come in!  Duke Mercator|57|is waiting for you!|5A|
03B9=|5A|Standing here like this|57|has been my dream!|5A|
03BA=|5A|Welcome to the castle|57|of Arthur!  Anybody can go|57|through this gate!|5A|
03BB=|5A|You have not been invited|57|by Duke Mercator, have you?|5A|
03BC=|5A|This is not a place for|57|dirty little kids like you!|57|Get out of here!|5A|
03BD=|5A|Are you Nigel?  Hmmm...|57|...younger than I thought...|5A|
03BE=|5A|Going off to defeat Mir, eh?|57|Hope your mama's got|57|something black to wear!|5A|
03BF=|5A|Hahahahaha!!|5A|
03C0=|5A|Nigel!  You're alive!! I'm|57|impressed!  Duke Mercator will|57|praise you for your boldness!|5A|
03C1=|5A|You!  Halt!|57|...Heh heh, just kidding!|5A|
03C2=|5A|We are the first|57|kid-gatekeepers of|57|this castle.|5A|
03C3=|5A|Co-cock-o-o-oooo...|5A|
03C4=|5A|Why do men act like fools|57|when they fall in love?!|5A|
03C5=|5A|I made my fortune here,|57|so I'm going back to|57|the continent.|5A|
03C6=|5A|What bad timing!|57|I'm all ready, but the|57|ship can't leave!...|5A|
03C7=|5A|I think the money I saved|57|here will be enough for me|57|to start my own business.|5A|
03C8=|5A|I love the sea...|57|A brisk, salty breeze|57|makes me happy...|5A|
03C9=|5A|Duke Mercator boarded the|57|ship with armored soldiers|57|I've never seen before!|5A|
03CA=|5A|After they left,|57|the lighthouse suddenly|57|went out...|5A|
03CB=|5A|We were all so relieved to|57|see the lighthouse lit again.|5A|
03CC=|5A|Oh!|57|You found the |5A|?|57|Really?|5A|
03CD=|5A|We can see many|57|unusual things when the ship|57|from the continent arrives!|5A|
03CE=|5A|Have you seen the|57|princess staying in the|57|castle?  She's so cute!|5A|
03CF=|5A|I finished unloading!|57|We'll go on a spree at|57|Greenpea's tonight!|5A|
03D0=|5A|As long as the lighthouse|57|is broken, the ship cannot|57|leave!|5A|
03D1=|5A|I come here once a|57|month with imported goods.|57|We sailors rely entirely on|5A|
03D2=|5A|the lighthouse of Ryuma|57|because the island is|57|enveloped in a dense fog.|5A|
03D3=|5A|The lighthouse is|57|out of order!  How will I|57|steer my ship!|5A|
03D4=|5A|The ship for Verla|57|will be leaving port soon!|5A|
03D5=|5A|Weigh anchor, weigh yo-ho!|57|Waves breaking, weigh yo-ho!|57|Hey-ho, let's go!|5A|
03D6=|5A|This is the new number|57|one song of the week on|57|the continent now!  Know it?|5A|
03D7=|5A|Weigh anchor, weigh yo-ho!|57|We're stuck here, way to go!|57|Hey, yo-ho, let me go!|5A|
03D8=|5A|This is no time for singing!|57|The situation's critical!|5A|
03D9=|5A|The taxes here are|57|killing me!  Cut 'em short,|57|I say...end of story!|5A|
03DA=|5A|Sorry!  This warehouse|57|is for traders only.|5A|
03DB=|5A|Do come in and look around|57|the warehouse!  You're sure|57|to find something you like!|5A|
03DC=|5A|See you next month!|57|Have a good day!|5A|
03DD=|5A|Have you heard about|57|General Arthur?|58|
03DE=|5A|He was seriously|57|injured!  Now he's under|57|strict medical care.|5A|
03DF=|5A|I think General Arthur|57|will make a great ruler!|5A|
03E0=|5A|He's in charge of the Royal|57|Guard, now.  His main concern|57|is foiling the duke's plans...|5A|
03E1=|5A|He was seriously injured!|57|Now he's under strict|57|medical care.|5A|
03E2=|5A|I think General Arthur|57|will make a great ruler!|5A|
03E3=|5A|Do you think those who|57|buy 100 EkeEke at a time|57|are stupid?  So do I!|5A|
03E4=|5A|Gambling is like a drug!|57|Once you get started, you|57|can never get enough!...|5A|
03E5=|5A|Greenpea is the name|57|of the owner here.|5A|
03E6=|5A|I'm the ship's captain.  I'm|57|just like anyone else on land,|57|but on the sea, I'm king!...|5A|
03E7=|5A|When the lighthouse is fixed,|57|I can go back to being a|57|captain again.|5A|
03E8=|5A|Ahoy, matey!  Didja hear?|57|The lighthouse is fixed!  I'm|57|a captain again!  Ha ha!!|5A|
03E9=|5A|This skeleton killed many|57|friends of mine!  This is|57|my revenge!|5A|
03EA=|5A|If he were out of that cell,|57|I'd be no match for him!|5A|
03EB=|5A|To get the armlet is|57|to prove oneself worthy|57|to enter the tower!|5A|
03EC=|5A|Is that the armlet?|57|You really did it?  Gee...!!|57|If you were|5A|
03ED=|5A|strong and smart enough to|57|get the armlet, Mir should be|57|no problem for you...|5A|
03EE=|5A|The goods you purchased|57|will be sent directly to your|57|shop with the bill.  Thanks!|5A|
03EF=|5A|This is Duke Mercator's|57|private pier.|57|You can't go in.|5A|
03F0=|5A|Welcome to|57|the castle of Mercator!|5A|
03F1=|5A|Nigel!  I have great|57|respect for you!|57|You're my ideal!!|5A|
03F2=|5A|Please, please come|57|back safe and sound!|57|Good luck...!|5A|
03F3=|5A|Please come back|57|safe and sound!|57|I'll pray for you!|5A|
03F4=|5A|Nigel!  Welcome back!|57|Thank heavens the goddess|57|accepted my prayer!|5A|
03F5=|5A|Nigel!|57|I thought you were...|57|the Duke and some strange|5A|
03F6=|5A|armored soldiers suddenly...|5A|
03F7=|5A|Terrible...!|5A|
03F8=|5A|All the other soldiers have|57|gone somewhere with the Duke.|57|I'm the only one remaining...|5A|
03F9=|5A|I am not fit to be a soldier.|57|I'll assist General Arthur|57|in his duties from now on.|5A|
03FA=|5A|Take care of yourself!|5A|
03FB=|5A|Beautiful courtyard, huh?|57|The gardener must be highly|57|skilled to keep it so nice...|5A|
03FC=|5A|Would you like to see him?|57|Surprise!!...it's me,|57|heh, heh, heh...|5A|
03FD=|5A|Why did the Orc King|57|cross the road?|5A|
03FE=|5A|Because he wanted to|57|eat the chicken|57|on the other side.  Ha!|5A|
03FF=|5A|Now the taxes will be|57|lowered and I can get|57|a better salary...I hope.|5A|
0400=|5A|Strange!|57|Giant monsters like soldiers|57|were following Duke Mercator!|5A|
0401=|5A|How strange!.....|5A|
0402=|5A|I don't care who owns the|57|castle.  I'll always be the|57|gardener of this courtyard...|5A|
0403=|5A|Cock-a-doodle-dooooo!|5A|
0404=|5A|Cock-a-cock-a-co....|5A|
0405=|5A|Oh, this is the kitchen door!|57|A distinguished guest like you|57|should use the front door....|5A|
0406=|5A|La-la-la...la-la...|57|Why am I so happy?  Well,|57|when I was cleaning the garden,|5A|
0407=|5A|I saw a beautiful hair|57|ornament fall to the ground, a|57|very expensive one!  Lucky me!|5A|
0408=|5A|This door is not fit for|57|a hero!  Would you please|57|use the front door?|5A|
0409=|5A|Strange armored soldiers|57|suddenly rushed into the|57|castle!  General Arthur is|5A|
040A=|5A|fighting against them alone!|57|Please save him!  HURRY!!|5A|
040B=|5A|Where has the Duke gone?|57|What is he going to do?|5A|
040C=|5A|The party will be|57|ready soon.  Please feel free|57|to look around the castle.|5A|
040D=|5A|Mr. Nigel, the party is ready.|57|It's being held in the banquet|57|room on the second floor.|5A|
040E=|5A|You can't go out now|57|It's getting dark.|5A|
040F=|5A|It's for your safety.|57|Please take a rest in your|57|room for the night.|5A|
0410=|5A|Mir is a plague to the duke|57|and the town.  Please defeat|57|him for us!|5A|
0411=|5A|I'm glad to see you again!|57|Please go up and see the Duke.|5A|
0412=|5A|You cannot go out today.|5A|
0413=|5A|Everything is ready!|57|Would you go on up|57|to the banquet room?|5A|
0414=|5A|You can't go out today.|57|Please rest quietly in|57|your room.|5A|
0415=|5A|We're counting on you|57|to return safe and sound!|5A|
0416=|5A|Duke Mercator is|57|waiting for you!|5A|
0417=|5A|Training rooms for|57|the soldiers from here.|5A|
0418=|5A|Excuse us, sir!|57|The new employees often|57|behave rudely to the guests...|5A|
0419=|5A|I must humbly apologize|57|on their behalf.....please|57|forgive us.|5A|
041A=|5A|Working here, I get to|57|see the nobility from|57|various countries.|5A|
041B=|5A|Just recently, I had a chance|57|to meet Princess Lara from|57|Maple.  She was really cute!|5A|
041C=|5A|But since then...|57|...nothing!|5A|
041D=|5A|We are told not to speak|57|with the guests...|57|Please excuse me.|5A|
041E=|5A|The paintings and ornaments|57|in this castle are|57|well known for their|5A|
041F=|5A|historic value.  Incidentally,|57|this picture is by the famous|57|Van Dough.  If you|5A|
0420=|5A|really want it, I'm sure|57|the duke would sell it to you.|57|Only 50,000 golds...cheap!|5A|
0421=|5A|Collecting art|57|is the duke's hobby.|5A|
0422=|5A|What a surprise!|57|Mr. Zak, the Dragonute, said|57|that he would buy this one!|5A|
0423=|5A|Is bounty hunting such a|57|good job?  Hmmmmm.....|5A|
0424=|5A|This mansion is so large,|57|it takes me one whole day|57|to clean the walls...|5A|
0425=|5A|Cleaning the walls is|57|very hard work.|57|So, I'm taking the day off!|5A|
0426=|5A|Mr. Dexter?  No, I don't|57|know where he is now|57|He was gone by the time I|5A|
0427=|5A|came to clean his room.....|5A|
0428=|5A|That's your maid over there.|57|She'll show you to your room.|5A|
0429=|5A|An evil magician is|57|tormenting Duke Mercator.|57|The duke has been avoiding|5A|
042A=|5A|a direct confrontation|57|out of consideration for the|57|townspeople, but...|5A|
042B=|5A|you'll hear more about it|57|at the dinner party.|5A|
042C=|5A|You need some rest now.|5A|
042D=|5A|There is a barrier at|57|the door to Mir's tower.|57|I think General Arthur|5A|
042E=|5A|discovered a way to break|57|it.|5A|
042F=|5A|Nigel, hmm...I'm sure I've|57|heard that name before....|57|Of course!  You're the one who|5A|
0430=|5A|stole the Statue of|57|Jypta, aren't you?|58|
0431=|5A|I knew it!  But don't|57|worry...your secret's safe|57|with me.....|5A|
0432=|5A|Yes, you are!|57|A veteran bounty hunter can|57|easily tell his fellow thief!|5A|
0433=|5A|But don't worry!  The|57|5000 Gold reward for your|57|head is peanuts to me!|5A|
0434=|5A|This gorgeous castle is|57|well worth exploring.....|5A|
0435=|5A|A dinner party!|57|Do they serve any of my|57|favorites, like raw meat?|5A|
0436=|5A|You may tag along|57|behind me tomorrow|57|if you want.|5A|
0437=|5A|It must be kind of a|57|burden to be so puny!|5A|
0438=|5A|Duke Mercator was a|57|famous swordsman in Gamoor.|57|I look up to him.|5A|
0439=|5A|To be invited by the duke|57|is a great honor!  I waited|57|over 20 years to get|5A|
043A=|5A|this chance...but you look|57|very young!  How old are you?|5A|
043B=|5A|I would give my life to be|57|of any service to him!|5A|
043C=|5A|I'm proud of my job!|5A|
043D=|5A|Mr. Nigel, would you|57|please go to the banquet room?|5A|
043E=|5A|I'm proud of my job!|5A|
043F=|5A|Good morning, Mr. Nigel!|5A|
0440=|5A|We have to take care of|57|VIPs everyday. It sometimes|57|wears my nerves thin.|5A|
0441=|5A|Have fun at the party!|5A|
0442=|5A|We have to take care of|57|VIPs everyday.  It can really|57|frazzle my nerves...|5A|
0443=|5A|Mr. Zak and Mr. Dexter|57|took off early this morning.|5A|
0444=|5A|I'm sorry, but we're busy|57|preparing for the party now.|5A|
0445=|5A|Everyone is waiting.|57|Please come in.|5A|
0446=|5A|I'm sorry, but Duke Mercator|57|has gone to bed.  He's not|57|feeling very well tonight...|5A|
0447=|5A|Mr. Zak left|57|quite a while back.....|5A|
0448=|5A|Arf, arf...|5A|
0449=|5A|Bow-wow!|5A|
044A=|5A|I'm a member of the duke's|57|Royal Guard.  I'm guarding|57|the duke with my life!|5A|
044B=|5A|The duke is a gentleman,|57|but a little nervous.|5A|
044C=|5A|It is said that nobody|57|ever left that tower alive.|57|Please be careful!|5A|
044D=|5A|I'm the duke's maid.|57|If you need anything, please|57|call one of the other maids.|5A|
044E=|5A|It's time for the dinner|57|party.  The banquet room is|57|on the second floor.|5A|
044F=|5A|Duke Mercator is|57|out now.|5A|
0450=|5A|This is the library.|57|I'm happiest when I'm|57|surrounded by a lot of books.|5A|
0451=|5A|It's almost impossible|57|to get into Mir's tower.|57|That barrier cannot be broken.|5A|
0452=|5A|I was surprised to see|57|two horrible monsters|57|following some great beauty |5A|
0453=|5A|out of the basement!|57|Who were they?  And|57|what were they doing there?|5A|
0454=|5A|Hey boy!  Are you a rookie?|57|We have a banquet tonight,|57|so shake a leg!|5A|
0455=|5A|Oh!...are you a guest?|57|Oops!...er, um...|57|...excuse me, sir!|5A|
0456=|5A|I'm worn out!|57|Catering a banquet is no|57|picnic!|5A|
0457=|5A|Hiccup!...wooops...|57|Er, this cooking sherry needs|57|more salt!...hiccup!...|5A|
0458=|5A|How selfish she is!|57|She told me, "I'm on a diet.|57|Serve me a special menu|5A|
0459=|5A|with no meat, no fish!"|57|I really don't like her!  But|57|a guest is a guest...|5A|
045A=|5A|I don't like her!|57|She leaves the room untidy,|57|and her bathroom's always|5A|
045B=|5A|sloppy!  I've never|57|seen such an ill-bred woman!|5A|
045C=|5A|We are not allowed to|57|speak with the guests.|5A|
045D=|5A|We get to eat the leftovers|57|after the banquet.|5A|
045E=|5A|It's our only pleasure|57|in this job.|5A|
045F=|5A|A lot of leftovers in there?|57|Oh, happy day!|5A|
0460=|5A|I'm full!|57|Did you see that roast beef?|5A|
0461=|5A|I ate too much!  Never again!|57|By the way, do you know when|57|the next banquet is?|5A|
0462=|5A|Ulp!  I'm sorry!  I'm...|57|Oh...who are you?|57|I thought you were my boss!|5A|
0463=|5A|He's always scolding me...|5A|
0464=|5A|I'm just taking my break now.|5A|
0465=|5A|I've been on break since|57|ten this morning!|57|Heh heh heh...|5A|
0466=|5A|What?  The party's over?|57|Ahhh....breaktime!!|5A|
0467=|5A|This stew must be|57|extremely delicious!  It's|57|been cooking for three days!|5A|
0468=|5A|Banquets are a good|57|opportunity to show off|57|my abilities as a cook!|5A|
0469=|5A|I was very disappointed|57|to see that almost no one|57|cleaned his plate!|5A|
046A=|5A|What happened in there?|5A|
046B=|5A|When is the duke|57|coming back?  I have to|57|plan his dinner menu.|5A|
046C=|5A|We're serving fried|57|Gamoor lobsters and scallops!|57|Seafood is|5A|
046D=|5A|one of the duke's favorites.|5A|
046E=|5A|How was dinner?|57|The menu was really special,|57|wasn't it?|5A|
046F=|5A|I wish I had gone to the|57|banquet with you...What?|57|You didn't eat!  How come?|5A|
0470=|5A|Mr. Zak eats only raw meat?|57|I had no idea!...|5A|
0471=|5A|Did Mr. Zak like the|57|fried lobsters?|5A|
0472=|5A|Have you looked around|57|the castle?|5A|
0473=|5A|Mr. Nigel!  The party is|57|ready now.  Would you please|57|come to the banquet room?|5A|
0474=|5A|Please come to the|57|banquet room.  It's on the|57|second floor.|5A|
0475=|5A|You cannot leave|57|just yet....|5A|
0476=|5A|Long ago, there was|57|a huge war on the continent.|57|King Nole used this island|5A|
0477=|5A|as a base.  When the war|57|was over, the fortresses and|57|labyrinths were simply|5A|
0478=|5A|abandoned...many of them|57|stand to this day!|5A|
0479=|5A|The Dark Wizard of|57|the tower is very cunning!|57|The tower itself is like a|5A|
047A=|5A|storied maze.  There is|57|also a barrier to protect the|57|wizard from outsiders...|5A|
047B=|5A|I got a bonus today!|57|Want to go to Greenpea's and|57|watch me double it?|5A|
047C=|5A|Oh, I'm sorry!|57|We thought you were one of our|57|soldiers!  Did we scare you?|5A|
047D=|5A|We have to study|57|new tactics everyday!|5A|
047E=|5A|The other soldiers are|57|making the rounds outside.|5A|
047F=|5A|Everyone's out training.|57|Me?  Well, uh...umm...|5A|
0480=|5A|I-I'm minding the store|57|while they're gone!|5A|
0481=|5A|This is the newest formation!|57|How do you like it?|5A|
0482=|5A|We modeled it after the|57|movement of some monsters|57|we saw in a cave.|5A|
0483=|5A|Don't interrupt!|57|It's just training, but I still|57|have to concentrate!|5A|
0484=|5A|Out of the way, kid!|57|This is serious.  I've got|57|60 golds riding on this fight!|5A|
0485=|5A|Sir Nigel, welcome to|57|the castle.  Enjoy thy stay!|5A|
0486=|5A|I think the party|57|is ready now.|5A|
0487=|5A|Why dost thou not go|57|to the banquet room?|5A|
0488=|5A|Art thou really going to|57|the tower?  'Tis a very|57|dangerous place!|5A|
0489=|5A|Didst thou know there|57|is a magic barrier at the|57|entrance to the tower?|5A|
048A=|5A|My investigations revealed|57|that an armlet is necessary|57|to break the barrier|5A|
048B=|5A|'Tis somewhere in the|57|underground crypt next to the|57|church.  I keep sending|5A|
048C=|5A|my best scouts in there,|57|but somehow they never|57|seem to return...I think|5A|
048D=|5A|there must be traps or|57|some such protecting the|57|armlet.|5A|
048E=|5A|Sir Nigel!|57|Get the armlet and|57|defeat Mir for the Duke!|5A|
048F=|5A|Dexter and Zak came through|57|here a little while ago.  They|57|asked me how to break the|5A|
0490=|5A|barrier, and left for|57|the crypt.  Sir Nigel,|57|I must warn you that|5A|
0491=|5A|the monsters down there|57|are very intelligent.  Perhaps|57|Mir cast a spell on them.|5A|
0492=|5A|Remember- thou can'st|57|find the armlet if thou dost|57|rely on thy sword alone.|5A|
0493=|5A|Take care of thyself!|5A|
0494=|5A|...go...upstairs|57|and... cut the... armor|5A|
0495=|5A|Nice to see thee again.|57|As thou dost see, I'm|57|completely healed now.|5A|
0496=|5A|I'll do my best to make|57|Mercator a good home for its|57|people.|5A|
0497=|5A|I've been thinking about|57|the relationship between|57|politics and the militia for|5A|
0498=|5A|a long time, now.  Julie|57|and I have often discussed|57|it, and I'm now convinced that|5A|
0499=|5A|I can make this town|57|prosper without a|57|military force!|5A|
049A=|5A|So, I built a casino in|57|the town well to help lower|57|the taxes.|5A|
049B=|5A|Please drop by|57|if thou dost have the time.|5A|
049C=|5A|Visit me anytime!|57|Take care of thyself!|5A|
049D=|5A|Hello again, Sir Nigel.|57|Do you want this?|5A|
049E=|5A|This room is reserved|57|for special guests.|5A|
049F=|5A|Hey!  How did you|57|escape?!!  I'm not through|57|with you yet!!|5A|
04A0=|5A|Arrrrgh!  All I wanted was|57|a few, measly treasures!  Now|57|We're dead broke!|5A|
04A1=|5A|This is another fine mess|57|you've gotten me into!!|5A|
04A2=|5A|The way we could afford|57|to go back to the continent|57|was on the prison ship,|5A|
04A3=|5A|so I had them arrest me!|57|But, phew!  What a stink!|57|I can't stand it in here!|5A|
04A4=|5A|Stinky...slimy...YUK!!|57|Jailor!|57|Gimme a better room!!|5A|
04A5=|5A|I won't forget you|57|for this, Nigel!!  I swear one|57|day I'll pay you back!!|5A|
04A6=|5A|...burp!...|5A|
04A7=|5A|Give me those treasures!|5A|
04A8=|5A|Stiiiiinky...|5A|
04A9=|5A|...BURRRRP!!...|5A|
04AA=|5A|Slimeeeee...|5A|
04AB=|5A|All right, already!  Such|57|superior swordsmanship...|57|I was wrong, you convinced me!|5A|
04AC=|5A|Go ahead, take the treasures.|57|They're all yours, if you'll|57|just stop hitting me!|5A|
04AD=|5A|Wandering about in this|57|basement has completely|57|tired us out!  Please go on|5A|
04AE=|5A|ahead and save the princess.|57|The duke has taken Miss Lara|57|prisoner...please find her!|5A|
04AF=|5A|You came here just|57|following his words...|57|How innocent you are...!|5A|
04B0=|5A|My name is Old Gol.|57|I'm the keeper of Greenmaze.|57|My father was|5A|
04B1=|5A|once a keeper, too.|57|What can I do for you?|5A|
04B2=|5A||5A|, hmmmm...|57|Yes, it's hidden in the depths|57|of this forest, but...|5A|
04B3=|5A|The naughty little gnomes|57|that live here have|57|changed the routes|5A|
04B4=|5A|Do you need tips about|57|walking in the woods?|58|
04B5=|5A|First, don't look at the|57|bottom of the trees.  If|57|you see a gap between|5A|
04B6=|5A|the tops of two lines of|57|trees, it might be a route.|57|If you get stuck there,|5A|
04B7=|5A|try jumping up.  There|57|might be a hidden step or|57|obstacle in front of you|5A|
04B8=|5A|Also, there are many|57|underpasses.  Some are|57|shortcuts, and some are not.|5A|
04B9=|5A|You should memorize the|57|surroundings before going|57|down the underpass.|5A|
04BA=|5A|The |5A| is in|57|the northeast sector of|57|this forest.|5A|
04BB=|5A|You've found the |5A|!|5A|
04BC=|5A|Perhaps you know this|57|forest better than me!  Will|57|you take my place?|5A|
04BD=|5A|Bow-wow|5A|
04BE=|5A|I shall never forget|57|your kindness!|5A|
04BF=|5A|Hi, nice to meet you.|57|I can't see you, but you look|57|fine.  Something to eat?|5A|
04C0=|5A|I can't see you, but|57|you look happy.  Visit me|57|anytime you like.|5A|
04C1=|5A|I can't see you, but|57|you look brave.|5A|
04C2=|5A|Good afternoon.|57|Make yourself at home.|57|Ho ho ho...|5A|
04C3=|5A|Arf!  Arf!|57|Bow-wow-wow!|5A|
04C4=|5A|We cannot return to|57|our original forms until that|57|miserable witch is defeated.|5A|
04C5=|5A|Thanks again for|57|all you've done!|5A|
04C6=|5A|I want to see Bell!|57|I want to see Bell!|5A|
04C7=|5A|Are you a tourist?|57|You'd better go back.  All|57|the townspeople were|5A|
04C8=|5A|suddenly taken to the|57|mountains by strange soldiers.|57|I was fishing by the sea|5A|
04C9=|5A|at the time...|57|All that's left are a priest|57|and a sick old man...|5A|
04CA=|5A|I heard  you rescued|57|the people of this town!|57|Bravo!  Well done!|5A|
04CB=|5A|...cough...cough...|5A|
04CC=|5A|It's a miracle!  My health|57|suddenly came back to see them|57|all returned safe and sound!|5A|
04CD=|5A|Why did Duke Mercator|57|take all the people away?..|5A|
04CE=|5A|I'm happy now that|57|everything's back to normal...|5A|
04CF=|5A|Get the monster, please!|5A|
04D0=|5A|We're all from Verla.|57|Duke Mercator forced us to|57|dig this mine.|5A|
04D1=|5A|Our families were also|57|taken captive by his|57|soldiers...please save them!|5A|
04D2=|5A|This mine consists of three|57|forked tunnels.  You'll find|5A|
04D3=|5A|our friends caught somewhere|57|in the other two tunnels.|57|Please help us!|5A|
04D4=|5A|Whew!  What a relief!|57|No more digging!  Now I can|57|go back to my old job.|5A|
04D5=|5A|EEEEEEK!!!|5A|
04D6=|5A|Duke Mercator suddenly|57|appeared in town and|57|ordered his henchmen|5A|
04D7=|5A|to bring us here.|57|And I thought he was|57|such a gentleman...|5A|
04D8=|5A|Why did Duke Mercator|57|do such a terrible thing?|5A|
04D9=|5A|H-help!|57|S-somebody help!!|5A|
04DA=|5A|I was so scared!|5A|
04DB=|5A|I shall never forget the|57|fear I felt in the mines|57|for as long as I live.|5A|
04DC=|5A|We're OK! Kill him!|5A|
04DD=|5A|What was the duke|57|looking for in this|57|mine, anyway?|5A|
04DE=|5A|He kept us digging|57|morning, noon, and night!|5A|
04DF=|5A|The duke and his soldiers|57|left for Destel.  The dwarves|57|in that village are all|5A|
04E0=|5A|peaceful and good-natured.|57|They have no weapons to|57|protect themselves.|5A|
04E1=|5A|I'm afraid it'll be|57|a slaughter...|5A|
04E2=|5A|Go!  GO!!....|5A|
04E3=|5A|What's Duke Mercator|57|doing now...?|5A|
04E4=|5A|Nigel!  I really think|57|you're the only guy|57|who can defeat the duke!|5A|
04E5=|5A|Hold out!|5A|
04E6=|5A|The duke must have|57|sold us out for the treasures.|5A|
04E7=|5A|I know the mayor of Destel.|57|He comes here often to|57|buy fish.  He's a good man.|5A|
04E8=|5A|He said they live|57|peacefully there, growing|57|lovely, scented flowers...|5A|
04E9=|5A|He'll kill us!!|5A|
04EA=|5A|There is a small village on|57|the west side of this mine.|57|I saw Duke Mercator marching|5A|
04EB=|5A|with his soldiers along|57|the road that leads to|57|the village.|5A|
04EC=|5A|Do you know anything|57|about it?|57|What's going on?|5A|
04ED=|5A|The tunnel between|57|Mercator and Verla is|57|finally open.|5A|
04EE=|5A|I can go to|57|Greenpea's everyday!|5A|
04EF=|5A|Being kept in that dark and|57|cramped tunnel for so long|57|really stressed me out!|5A|
04F0=|5A|eeeeEEEEK!!!|5A|
04F1=|5A|Thank you very much.|57|You looked so cool|57|when you were fighting!|5A|
04F2=|5A|Don't look at ME...|57|GET 'im!|5A|
04F3=|5A|I overheard the duke's men|57|say the digging was over|57|because they found|5A|
04F4=|5A|what they were looking for.|5A|
04F5=|5A|I found the sword, but|57|I didn't tell the duke|57|about it!|5A|
04F6=|5A|Dig!  Dig!|5A|
04F7=|5A|I had my suspicions|57|all along that this was no|57|ordinary mine.|5A|
04F8=|5A|But who would have|57|guessed that a legendary|57|treasure was hidden there!|5A|
04F9=|5A|I have to keep at it.|57|Our lives are depending|57|on this...|5A|
04FA=|5A|That tunnel in the mine|57|is the only way|57|to go to Destel.|5A|
04FB=|5A|The sword?  We happened|57|to find it when we were|57|digging the tunnel.|5A|
04FC=|5A|I can't trust humans|57|anymore!|5A|
04FD=|5A|My house was ransacked|57|by many big soldiers!!...|5A|
04FE=|5A|Why are humans so rude?!|57|They came from out of nowhere|57|and trampled down our|5A|
04FF=|5A|flower beds...|57|If they wanted the jewel,|57|they should have asked me...|5A|
0500=|5A|Jewel?  someone named|57|Mercator found it and|57|took it away.|5A|
0501=|5A|Why does he want such a|57|worthless thing?  Flowers and|57|seeds are prettier...and they|5A|
0502=|5A|smell good, too!|5A|
0503=|5A|I was at the inn, talking|57|about the ancient cave under|57|this village, when some|5A|
0504=|5A|tourist suddenly rushed down|57|here, broke the seal, and|57|disappeared down the cave...|5A|
0505=|5A|I've never seen such|57|rudeness in all my life!|5A|
0506=|5A|I don't like the hectic|57|pace of life in crowded towns,|57|so I live here quietly|5A|
0507=|5A|with the dwarves.|5A|
0508=|5A|I think humans are wicked.|5A|
0509=|5A|Once I went down and|57|tried to look into the cave,|57|but it was impossible.|5A|
050A=|5A|I don't think you can do it.|5A|
050B=|5A|We just want to live|57|in peace...|5A|
050C=|5A|Dwarves are quite pious.|5A|
050D=|5A|I was scared!|57|The soldiers were|57|twice as tall as me!|5A|
050E=|5A|Kindly's Item Shop!|5A|
050F=|5A|I'm kind!|57|My brother is not...|5A|
0510=|5A|Welcome to the|57|village of Destel.|5A|
0511=|5A|This well is the entrance|57|to an ancient cave where|57|monsters dwell.|5A|
0512=|5A|Sometimes, late at night|57|you can hear something|57|roaring in this well...|5A|
0513=|5A|My flowerbed was|57|ruined.....|57|What were they looking for?|5A|
0514=|5A|I don't think I have|57|anything they'd want.|5A|
0515=|5A|Big, hulking soldiers rushed|57|into my house and demanded|57|to know where the jewel was!|5A|
0516=|5A|What were they talking|57|about?  I have nothing|57|but flower seeds.|5A|
0517=|5A|Duke Mercator suddenly|57|appeared and bought every|57|last raft I had!|5A|
0518=|5A|He paid me a whole|57|6 golds for them!  He said|57|he was going to the shrine.|5A|
0519=|5A|Sorry!  All sold out...|57|You can still get to the|57|shrine through the cave under|5A|
051A=|5A|Destel, but...|57|it's pretty dangerous.|5A|
051B=|5A|Beautiful waterfall, huh?|57|The people of Destel take good|57|care to keep the water clean.|5A|
051C=|5A|I make a good living here|57|off the treasure hunters|57|who visit this lake.|5A|
051D=|5A|Hi, stranger.  You are|57|the first visitor we've had|57|in 300 years.|5A|
051E=|5A|Wh-what?  Another|57|dictator has risen to power|57|on the surface?|5A|
051F=|5A|King Nole gave us eternal|57|youth in reward for building|57|his underground palace.|5A|
0520=|5A|I like the calm life here.|57|I don't want to go back|57|to the surface...|5A|
0521=|5A|You have to go through|57|a huge and complex labyrinth|57|to get to the palace.|5A|
0522=|5A|The maze was designed|57|by King Nole himself.|5A|
0523=|5A|It's impossible even|57|for us to go through.|5A|
0524=|5A|What a greedy man he was!|5A|
0525=|5A|There is no priest here,|57|but I've meditated on|57|the goddess for 300 years,|5A|
0526=|5A|so I am the substitute.|5A|
0527=|5A|I worked for King Nole|57|so I could have eternal life.|5A|
0528=|5A|But now I just idle my|57|time away|59|...|59|...|59|sigh!...|5A|
0529=|5A|Got any comic books?|5A|
052A=|5A|There are three monsters|57|in the labyrinth called|57|"Gehenna's Gatekeepers."|5A|
052B=|5A|You have to defeat them|57|to open the gateway|57|to the palace.|5A|
052C=|5A|Hi!  The original owner of|57|this shop left one day 200|57|years ago and never returned.|5A|
052D=|5A|Now, let's start|57|our adventure!!|5A|
052E=|5A|Omigosh...|57|LSTextManager!!|5A|
052F=|5A|I have to tell|57|Grampa!|5A|
0530=|5A|....|59|....o...|59|...au....|59|...|5A|
0531=|5A|He's still sleeping...|57|He didn't seem to be|57|the lazy type.....|5A|
0532=|5A|Let him sleep for a while.|57|You can stay in our village|57|as long as you want.|5A|
0533=|5A|Hurray!|57|That's a great idea!|5A|
0534=|5A|But we're in a hurry.|57|Nigel!  WAKE UP!!  It's time to|57|\UNUSEDcontinue our treasure hunt!|5A|
0535=|5A|Hi!  Are you OK now?|57|...well...\UNUSEDWhere is your friend?|57|Y'know, that mini-sized girl.|5A|
0536=|5A|How dare you call me|57|"mini-sized"!!|57|You hairy brute!|5A|
0537=|5A|Oops!  S-sorry!|57|Touchy, isn't she?|5A|
0538=|5A|The people of Gumi came|57|and smashed the bridge!|57|The bridge is broken!|5A|
0539=|5A|They must be possessed|57|by evil spirits!!  Somebody|57|please tell the mayor!!|5A|
053A=|5A|What a noisy boy!|5A|
053B=|5A|Allow me to introduce|57|myself--I'm Prospero.|57|What do you want?|5A|
053C=|5A|Hmmm...you came here|57|looking for the treasures|57|of King Nole...|5A|
053D=|5A|I'm sorry, but I know|57|absolutely nothing about|57|the treasures...|5A|
053E=|5A|However, I did|57|come across a fragment of|57|a document from the|5A|
053F=|5A|legend of King Nole|57|just the other day...|5A|
0540=|5A|What did it say?|5A|
0541=|5A|"Long, long ago, in the|57|age of King Nole, a vast horde|57|of soldiers came to this land."|5A|
0542=|5A|But why here?  The war|57|was on the continent...|5A|
0543=|5A|What good is|57|an island to soldiers?|5A|
0544=|5A|They must have come|57|to protect something very|57|valuable of King Nole's...|5A|
0545=|5A|Of course!!  That's it!|5A|
0546=|5A|Wait, wait.|5A|
0547=|5A|There's no reason to|57|assume they were protecting|57|the King's treasures!|5A|
0548=|5A|Maybe not, but|57|I can just feel it.|57|Anything else?|5A|
0549=|5A|I'll look it up in my|57|books.  Stop by later--I may|57|have something for you then...|5A|
054A=|5A|Nigel!  A terrible tragedy|57|occurred soon after you left!|5A|
054B=|5A|After we managed to|57|fix the bridge, Gumi thugs|57|marched in and kidnapped|5A|
054C=|5A|Fara...!|57|Oh, my little girl...!|5A|
054D=|5A|Hey, Nigel!|57|Look at the byroad!|57|We can go up the hill!|5A|
054E=|5A|Look!  It's Fara!|57|Let's go down from here!|5A|
054F=|5A|OK!  C'mon!|5A|
0550=|5A|Thumpa-thumpa, yo!|57|Sacrificial, beneficial,|57|nothing here is artificial,|5A|
0551=|5A|Undefiled, unbeguiled, please|57|accept this virgin child!|57|Thumpa-thumpa, yo!|5A|
0552=Nigel held up |5A||57|over the statue.|5A|
0553=|5A|You!  How did you get|57|in here?  Don't disturb|57|our sacred ceremony!|5A|
0554=|5A|Orc King!|57|Orc King!|5A|
0555=|5A|Grrrrr....|57|Gaorrrrrrrrrr|57|GRAAWWRRRR!!!|5A|
0556=|5A|Oh, Nigel...sigh!...|57|I just knew you'd come!|5A|
0557=|5A|I'd like to thank you again!|57|Please come to my house|57|when you've finished here!|5A|
0558=|5A|Nigel!  Thanks to you,|57|the people of Massan are|57|now our good friends.|5A|
0559=|5A|We'll repair the road!|57|Just stand clear for a sec...|5A|
055A=|5A|1-2-3!|5A|
055B=|5A|Heave-ho!  Heave-HO!!|5A|
055C=|5A|OK!  You can use the road|57|anytime, now!|5A|
055D=|5A|I heard them!|57|I heard them!|5A|
055E=|5A|The mayor was|57|killed by the thieves!|57|What a disaster!|5A|
055F=|5A|I have to tell|57|everybody in town!|5A|
0560=|5A|Are you going to|57|the thieves' hideout?|58|
0561=|5A|Let's go!|5A|
0562=|5A|Why not?|57|It could be fun!|5A|
0563=|5A|Are you going to|57|the thieves' hideout?|58|
0564=|5A|Let's go!|5A|
0565=|5A|Right.|57|We don't have to go.|5A|
0566=|5A|Are you going back|57|to town?|58|
0567=|5A|OK!  Let's go!|5A|
0568=|5A|We have a lot left|57|to do here.|5A|
0569=|5A|Hey, Nigel!|57|You didn't get all the|57|treasure chests!  Take a look!|5A|
056A=|5A|Who goes there?!!|57|Why, you puny...you'll|57|never go back alive!|5A|
056B=|5A|I don't know who you|57|are, but thanks!  I'm almost|57|dead from hunger and fright!|5A|
056C=|5A|Please visit me when|57|you get back into town!|57|I'm freeeeee!|5A|
056D=|5A|Nigel!  We have been|57|waiting for you!  I really|57|want to thank you!|5A|
056E=|5A|You can't imagine how|57|happy I am to return|57|to my job again!|5A|
056F=|5A|Please take this.|57|I hope it will help you.|5A|
0570=|5A|You can get into|57|Mercator with it.|5A|
0571=|5A|Hahahahahaha!|57|There you are!  Give me|57|that little witch at once!|5A|
0572=|5A|Wally!  Ink!|57|Row to the shore!|5A|
0573=|5A|The shore!|5A|
0574=|5A|The shore!|5A|
0575=|5A|What are you doing!|57|Hurry up!|5A|
0576=|5A|Oh, my....|5A|
0577=|5A|Drifting...away...|5A|
0578=|5A|Noooooo!|57|Now we're dead ducks!|5A|
0579=|5A|Nigel!  That's Gola,|57|one of the destructive gods|57|King Nole used to worship!|5A|
057A=|5A|Look!|57|Five stones are inlaid|57|on Gola's body...|5A|
057B=|5A|Let me read it...Here's|57|the gist, "Collect all five|57|stones to get Gola's eye."|5A|
057C=|5A|Hmmmm...looks like|57|the rest is nearly rubbed off.|5A|
057D=|5A|...Hey!|5A|
057E=|5A|What?|57|You see something?|5A|
057F=|5A|Look!  Does the|57|shape of Gola|57|remind you of anything?...|5A|
0580=|5A|Of course!|57|It's a map of this island!|57|So, if Gola breathes fire...|5A|
0581=|5A|That means his mouth|57|is the volcano!  That's it!|57|And the five stones...|5A|
0582=|5A|...represent the locations|57|of the jewels!  Brilliant!|5A|
0583=|5A|Then Gola's eye must|57|stand for.........|5A|
0584=|5A|No!  No!|5A|
0585=|5A|Hahahahahaha!  Great!|57|Now I know the location of the|57|treasures!  Lucky me!|5A|
0586=|5A|Hand me that lithograph,|57|and your little friend can|57|go free!  OK?|5A|
0587=|5A|Help me, Nigel!|5A|
0588=|5A|Darn!|5A|
0589=|5A|Pass it!|57|Or he'll eat her up!|5A|
058A=|5A|Double darn!|5A|
058B=Nigel handed over the |5A|.|5A|
058C=|5A|Hahahahaha!  Good boy!|5A|
058D=|5A|I don't need her|57|any more!  'Bye now!|5A|
058E=|5A|Oooooo!!|5A|
058F=|5A|I'll never forgive her!|57|Nigel!  Nigel!|5A|
0590=|5A|...the...the lithograph...!|5A|
0591=|5A|No problem!  I saw|57|enough to remember the|57|location of the jewels!|5A|
0592=|5A|Let's go!|5A|
0593=|5A|I only pretended|57|to be scared!|5A|
0594=|5A|Really?  That's the|57|first time I ever saw|57|such a thing...|5A|
0595=|5A|Hello.  I'm Purin.|57|I'm twelve.  Madame Yard is my|57|mom.  Wanna play?|5A|
0596=|5A|I like you!|57|Would you be my boyfriend?|58|
0597=|5A|Sigh!...oh, well.....|5A|
0598=|5A|Hey, Nigel!|57|What are you thinking of?!|5A|
0599=|5A|Wow-wee!|5A|
059A=|5A|Mercator men tend to|57|do some pretty stupid|57|things for love...!|5A|
059B=|5A|Oh, Julie!  Julie!|57|If ya won't marry me, I'll|57|throw myself offa this wall!|5A|

059E=|5A|Only invited guests|57|are allowed to enter|57|the castel of Mercator!|5A|
059F=|5A|This castle is no place|57|for a dirty little kid like|57|you!  Scram!  Beat it!|5A|
05A0=|5A|You can come in now,|57|but...|5A|
05A1=|5A|you can't pass this gate|57|for free!   Heh, heh, heh...|5A|
05A2=|5A|Listen.  I'm a little|57|strapped for cash, and|57|baby needs a new pair|5A|
05A3=|5A|of shoes...|5A|
05A4=|5A|Heh heh...I'll letcha in|57|for |5A| golds.  Whaddaya say?|58|

05A6=|5A|your money, there's a place|57|called Greenpea's in town.|57|You may gain, or you may lose.|5A|
05A7=|5A|It all depends on your luck!|5A|
05A8=|5A|...Is that all?|57|OK, go ahead!|5A|

05AD=|5A|I'm sorry, but it's|57|my job.  I can't do it if you|57|don't have enough money.|5A|
05AE=|5A|Take care of yourself!|5A|
05AF=|5A|Do you want to hear|57|the rules?|58|
05B0=|5A|I'll change into various|57|monsters who will attack you|57|one after the other.|5A|
05B1=|5A|I'll evaluate your|57|skill by the number of|57|monsters you defeat|5A|
05B2=|5A|without getting hit.|57|Once you get hit, it's over.|5A|
05B3=|5A|Your reward will be based on|57|the number of monsters you kill.|57|Got it?|5A|
05B4=|5A|Now, ready...|59|set...|59|GO!|5A|

05BC=|5A|I'll give you |5A| golds|57|if you stop now.|5A|
05BD=|5A|Want to continue?|57||58|

05C6=|5A|Imagine!  A little kid...|57|I need a vacation!|5A|

05CB=|5A|Thanks!  Do you need to|57|know how to play?|58|
05CC=|5A|Oops!|57|Come again when|57|you have more money!|5A|
05CD=|5A|Are you nuts?|57|Don't you like gambling?|5A|
05CE=|5A|Throw the ball over|57|the counter so it lands on|57|the moving plates.|5A|
05CF=|5A|The faster the plate your|57|ball lands on, the more|57|money you win!  400, 100, 50.|5A|
05D0=|5A|If the ball slides off,|57|you lose!  You have only|57|one throw.|5A|
05D1=|5A|Are you ready?|57|Okay!  Then, let's go!|5A|

05D6=|5A|Please!  Go away...|57|Don't come back!|57|I beg you...|5A|

0605=|5A|Fair Julie!|57|Shut the door, please...|5A|

0609=|5A|No!|5A|
060A=|5A|....I...I...\UNUSEDI give up...|5A|
060B=|5A|You're a strong lad.|57|I knew it when I saw the way|57|you carried yourself|5A|
060C=|5A|with a sword.|5A|
060D=|5A|Since I cannot force|57|thy silence, I must ask thee|57|as a gentleman- please,|5A|
060E=|5A|tell not a soul thou hast|57|met me here.  If you promise|57|not to, I'll invite thee|5A|
060F=|5A|to the castle.  Duke|57|Mercator is now looking|57|for reliable mercenaries.|5A|
0610=|5A|The duke will be|57|well pleased to|57|see thy skill.|5A|
0611=|5A|What is thy name?|5A|
0612=|5A|...Nigel.|5A|
0613=|5A|Then, I shall await thee|57|at the castle, Sir Nigel!|5A|
0614=|5A|Welcome, Mr. Nigel.|57|I've heard stories of your|57|great work in Ryuma.|5A|
0615=|5A|Come this way.|57|Please look around the castle|57|later if you like.|5A|
0616=|5A|Please stay here.|57|The duke will greet you|57|momentarily...|5A|
0617=|5A|Deel Klesso ma hahm.|5A|
0618=|5A|I said,|57|"welcome to my mansion."|57|in Gammorian.|5A|
0619=|5A|Gentlemen, I have read|57|reports on each one of you.|5A|
061A=|5A|Nigel, you're originally|57|from Maple.  Your work|57|in Ryuma was excellent!|5A|
061B=|5A|Dexter, you come to us|57|from B'el-ar.  Your reputation|57|as a swordsman preceeds you!|5A|
061C=|5A|And last, but not least,|57|Zak, the pride and joy|57|of Drakkonia.|5A|
061D=|5A|You're known throughout the|57|land as a fearless|57|bounty hunter.|5A|
061E=|5A|I'd like to offer you each|57|an assignment.  Tonight,|57|I'm having a banquet|5A|
061F=|5A|in your honor.  We'll|57|discuss the terms in detail|57|at the party...see you then!|5A|
0620=|5A|Your room is|57|ready upstairs.|5A|
0621=|5A|I'll come and tell you|57|when the party is ready.|57|Please make yourself at home.|5A|
0622=|5A|Hail, Sir Nigel.|57|This is the Training Room.|5A|
0623=|5A|Please don't tell|57|a soul about Julie...|5A|
0624=|5A|Please don't|57|tell a soul about Julie...|5A|
0625=|5A|By the way,|57|I think it's time|57|to go to the party.|5A|
0626=|5A|Why dost thou not go to|57|the banquet room?|5A|
0627=|5A|Hahahahaha!|57|Nice to meet you again!|57|Hahahahahahaha!|5A|
0628=|5A|I've been waiting for|57|you!  Now, come here!|58|
0629=|5A|Hey, Nigel!|57|I can't understand you|57|at all!  She's a rival!|5A|
062A=|5A|She snatched the|57|lithograph!  She looks|57|older than me!|5A|
062B=|5A|Mr. Nigel, would you|57|please come to the banquet|57|room?  Everyone is waiting.|5A|
062C=|5A|Sorry, Nigel...|57|I got a little excited...|5A|
062D=|5A|You refused me!|57|I've never been|57|refused before!|5A|
062E=|5A|Ink!  Wally!|5A|
062F=|5A|You were off your|57|guard when you saw her nude...|5A|
0630=|5A|Please come in.|5A|
0631=|5A|I'm sure you're anxious|57|to hear what the Duke|57|has to say to you all.|5A|
0632=|5A|As you know, an evil|57|magician lives in the tower|5A|
0633=|5A|Just outside of town.|57|He's a terrible nuisance|57|to me, and to this town.|5A|
0634=|5A|The name of this wizard|57|is Mir.  Ever since he|57|settled in that tower,|5A|
0635=|5A|we've been afraid for|57|our very lives...We've done|57|everything he asked.|5A|
0636=|5A|I sometimes thought|57|of sending soldiers to the|57|tower...but his strong magic|5A|
0637=|5A|might have harmed|57|the innocent citizens|57|of Mercator.|5A|
0638=|5A|So I've been giving|57|him all the golds he wants.|5A|
0639=|5A|But I will stand for it|57|no longer!|5A|
063A=|5A|...Oh, I...beg your pardon!|57|Perhaps I rambled on a bit...|5A|
063B=|5A|Shall I say it again?|58|
063C=|5A|I think it's time we defeated|57|this Mir.  The peaceful town|57|of Mercator will|5A|
063D=|5A|never know true peace|57|as long as he lives.|5A|
063E=|5A|So, I sent for you.|57|I'd like YOU to defeat Mir!|57|Of course, I'm prepared|5A|
063F=|5A|to offer you a rich|57|reward.  It so happens I have|57|in my possession the|5A|
0640=|5A|Golan Emerald, one of the|57|national treasures of|57|this fair land.|5A|
0641=|5A|Dexter... Zak...and Nigel,|57|you'll be heroes throughout|57|this proud nation|5A|
0642=|5A|for all time!  May the|57|goddess help you three!|5A|
0643=|5A|That's all I have to say.|57|Now, let's enjoy the banquet!|57|Do you like music?|5A|
0644=|5A|Let me introduce|57|the world-famous composer and|57|pianist, Mr. Ludwig.|5A|
0645=|5A|Thank you.|57|Tonight, I shall play for you|57|my latest work.|5A|
0646=|5A|Bravo!  That was wonderful!|57|Ludwig, may I have the title|57|of this darling opus?|5A|
0647=|5A|...I wrote it...|57|for Princess Lara of Maple.|5A|
0648=|5A|Duke, please tell me!|57|I have to know!  Why did|57|she disappear?!!...|5A|
0649=|5A|Enough!  Silence!|5A|
064A=|5A|Ludwig, you may|57|leave now.  Guards!!|57|Take him away!|5A|
064B=|5A|If you'll all excuse me,|57|I suddenly feel...unwell.|5A|
064C=|5A|I think I shall|57|retire to my chambers|57|for the evening...|5A|
064D=|5A|Gentlemen,|57|please enjoy the party.|5A|
064E=|5A|I'm expecting|57|much of you!  Good luck.|5A|
064F=|5A|Nigel, are you going|57|to bed for the night?|58|
0650=|5A|Let's go|57|explore the castle, then.|5A|
0651=|5A|...Nigel...Nigel!|57|Are you awake?|5A|
0652=|5A|.....ah|57|...yeah...z...|57|...z?...|5A|
0653=|5A|To tell you the truth,|57|I really should thank Kayla...|57|Know why?  Because if she|5A|
0654=|5A|hadn't chased after me|57|like that, I would never|57|have met you!...|5A|
0655=|5A|I don't know why,|57|but I feel so happy|57|just being near you...|5A|
0656=|5A|and...so...|57|Hey, are you listening to me?|57|Nigel?...Nigel!|5A|
0657=|5A|mm...mm.........|5A|
0658=|5A|What will you do after|57|you get the treasures?|57|Go back to the continent?|5A|
0659=|5A|And what about me?|57|What should I do?|57|Nigel?...Nigel!|5A|
065A=|5A|...Good night, Nigel!|5A|
065B=|5A|Excuse me, Mr. Nigel?|57|I...it's about Princess Lara...|57|She's not really...|5A|
065C=|5A|Hey, you!|57|What are you doing!|5A|
065D=|5A|Look, Nigel!|57|Something's falling.|5A|
065E=|5A|What a beautiful ribbon!|57|Did somebody drop it?|5A|
065F=|5A|Hey, skeleton!|57|Yeah, you, Mr. Big Bad|57|Skeleton.  Remember me?|5A|
0660=|5A|Well look at you,|57|caught in a pen!|57|Hah hah!  C'mon!  C'mon!|5A|
0661=|5A|Huh!  You don't act so|57|tough now, do ya?|57|Ha ha ha!|5A|
0662=|5A|Would you invest|57||5A| golds in me?|58|
0663=|5A|Aren't you interested|57|in the money game?|5A|
0664=|5A|Thanks, kid!|57|Wait here, I'll double|57|your money in a jiffy!|5A|
0665=|5A| golds!|57|I always repay the kindness|57|I receive twice over.|5A|
0666=|5A|Hey, a buyer!|57|You want medicines?|57|Sure, we've got 'em all!|5A|
0667=|5A|Hey, a buyer!|57|You want variety goods?|57|Sure, we've got lots!|5A|
0668=|5A|We've got all kinds|57|of items, and of good|57|quality, too!|5A|
0669=|5A|Heh heh heh...|57|Here comes another victim...|57|Are you going to enter|5A|
066A=|5A|this Hall of the Undead|57|at all costs?|58|
066B=|5A|Brave boy!|57|You have to solve|57|eight riddles in eight rooms.|5A|
066C=|5A|If you correctly solve|57|the riddle for the room,|57|the torch will go out.|5A|
066D=|5A|You can go to the|57|other side of the river when|57|all eight riddles are solved.|5A|
066E=|5A|But, if you fail...|57|heh heh heh...it'll be|57|the end of your life...|5A|
066F=|5A|Go away!|57|Don't ever come here again!|5A|
0670=|5A|Heh heh heh...|57|there are still more riddles|57|to solve over there...|5A|
0671=|5A|Do you really want|57|to go across the river?|58|
0672=|5A|Heh heh heh...Indeed.|57|You had better go back...|5A|
0673=|5A|OK...heh heh...|57|I'll take you to...|57|Gehenna!!|5A|
0674=|5A|Heh heh heh...|57|So long...|5A|
0675=|5A|...Impossible...|57|How is it you came back alive?|5A|
0676=|5A|...Are you going|57|back to town?|58|
0677=|5A|Do as you like.|5A|
0678=|5A|...C'mon...|5A|
0679=|5A|I can see there's|57|something about you...|57|I don't know what it is...|5A|
067A=|5A|Heh heh heh...|57|Welcome back from the pit...|5A|
067B=|5A|Are you going back?|58|
067C=|5A|Do as you like.|5A|
067D=|5A|Heh heh heh...|5A|
067E=|5A|Heh heh...come back|57|anytime you like...the undead|57|are always waiting...|5A|
067F=The magic barrier|57|prevented you from going in.|5A|
0680=Nigel held the |5A||57|up over the entrance!|5A|
0681=|5A|Are you going in|57|at all costs?|58|
0682=|5A|Go back now.|57|Never step foot in this|57|tower again.|5A|
0683=|5A|Anything I can do for you?|58|
0684=|5A|Go back right now!|5A|
0685=|5A|Do you dare come in?|58|
0686=|5A|I think you had better|57|go back...|5A|
0687=|5A|Ha ha ha ha ha!...|5A|
0688=|5A|Pew!!  Smells bad!|5A|
0689=|5A|You again!|57|Go away!  Go away!!|5A|
068A=|5A|You don't have to feel|57|so ashamed.|57|It's not your fault.|5A|
068B=|5A|You've done well.|57|Now, back to the dust.|57|from whence you came!|5A|
068C=|5A|Tser ot...fle Siht tup!...|5A|
068D=|5A|Brave young man,|57|You're the first person to|57|reach the top of this tower.|5A|
068E=|5A|What is your purpose?|57|Why did you come to see me?|57|I'm...|5A|
068F=|5A|Shut up!  We came here|57|to defeat you!|5A|
0690=|5A|The people of Mercator|57|will no longer bow down|57|to your wicked whims!|5A|
0691=|5A|Now, Nigel!  Get him!|5A|
0692=|5A|You won't listen...|57|All right, then.|57|Come on!|5A|
0693=|5A|I give up!|5A|
0694=|5A|I..I...lost...!  How strong|57|you are!  You shall have|57|whatever you desire.|5A|
0695=|5A|Give me the jewel.  Also,|57|stop extorting money from the|57|good people of Mercator!|5A|
0696=|5A|The jewel is yours.|57|But it's not me making|57|the unbearable demands.|5A|
0697=|5A|It's the duke.|5A|
0698=|5A|Really!??|5A|
0699=|5A|He's my brother.|57|Ever since we were little,|57|his one ambition has been|5A|
069A=|5A|to conquer the continent.|57|He'll commit any wrong|57|to achieve his dream!|5A|
069B=|5A|He finally shut me|57|up in this tower because I|57|used to admonish him|5A|
069C=|5A|for his crimes...|5A|
069D=|5A|Gosh!|57|The duke is such a...|5A|
069E=|5A|Yes...it's really the|57|duke who imposes this|57|heavy tax on them.|5A|
069F=|5A|I just live out my life here,|57|day by day, quietly waiting|57|for a true champion|5A|
06A0=|5A|to appear...|5A|
06A1=|5A|Duke Mercator is only|57|pretending to be a gentleman!|57|What a liar!!|5A|
06A2=|5A|The jewel is downstairs.|57|Once you've found it, I'll|57|send you back|5A|
06A3=|5A|to the entrance to the tower.|5A|
06A4=|5A|I'm going to send you|57|directly to the ground, OK?|58|
06A5=|5A|Mr. Nigel!|57|You did it!|5A|
06A6=|5A|The duke is waiting for you!|57|Tell us of your exploits at|57|the tower in detail!|5A|
06A7=|5A|Mr. Nigel!|57|I'm very glad to see you!|5A|
06A8=|5A|I'm anxious to see the|57|jewel you freed from the|57|tower!|5A|
06A9=|5A|I always try to be one step|57|ahead of the competition...|5A|
06AA=|5A|Why, whatever's the matter?|57|You look positively ill...|5A|
06AB=|5A|Well, maybe the sight|57|of a beautiful lady will|57|make you feel better.|5A|
06AC=|5A|Miss Kayla Kozwalski!|5A|
06AD=|5A|Hahahahahaha!|5A|
06AE=|5A|Well done, boy!|57|Ol' Duke and I agreed to share|57|the treasures of King Nole!|5A|
06AF=|5A|You went to the tower|57|FOR us!  Hahahahahaha!|57|What a useful errand boy!|5A|
06B0=|5A|Wally!  Ink!|57|Don't you agree?|5A|
06B1=|5A|Agreeeee!|5A|
06B2=|5A|Agreeeee!|5A|
06B3=|5A|Hahahahaha!|57|Do you want to go to get|57|two more jewels for us?|5A|
06B4=|5A|Hahahahahaha!|57|The treasures are ours!|5A|
06B5=|5A|Hahaha...uh-oh!|5A|
06B6=|5A|Ohhhhhhhh!....|5A|
06B7=|5A|Noooooooo!.....|5A|
06B8=|5A|What a bunch of dweebs!|57|Those treasures are all mine.|57|Share?  No way!|5A|
06B9=|5A|Soldiers!|57|Take the jewels from Mr. Nigel!|5A|
06BA=The red and purple jewels|57|were taken away from Nigel!|5A|
06BB=|5A|Mr. Nigel!  Have a|57|good time with that|57|silly old cow!  Ha ha ha!|5A|
06BC=|5A|Hey!  How did you escape?|57|You haven't seen|57|the last of us!|5A|
06BD=|5A|Give me the treasures!|5A|
06BE=|5A|Help meeee!|5A|
06BF=|5A|Thank you very much.|57|I almost gave up hope...|5A|
06C0=|5A|Me?  I'm Moralis, the|57|Educational Minister of Maple.|5A|
06C1=|5A|I'm the personal custodian|57|of Princess Lara De Wissica.|5A|
06C2=|5A|Well, where is the princess?|57|I have to look for her!|57|Princess!|5A|
06C3=|5A|No!|57|Don't touch me!|57|P-please...don't touch me!|5A|
06C4=|5A|I'm warning you...|57|I have a knife!|5A|
06C5=|5A|.......|57|What?|57|......|5A|
06C6=|5A|You came to save me?|57|...Really...?|5A|
06C7=|5A|Duke Mercator locked|57|the princess up somewhere|57|in the castle.  Save her!|5A|
06C8=|5A|ARRRRRRRRR!!|57|It's the end of the line|57|for you!|5A|
06C9=|5A|GARRRRRRRR!!!|57|Elf boy fall down, go BOOM!|5A|
06CA=|5A|HARRRRRRRR!!!|57|Time for all little boys to|57|go dead...er, bed!|5A|
06CB=|5A|Hello, boy!  I watched|57|your funny little adventure in|57|Mir's tower from the wings.|5A|
06CC=|5A|You know, I knew|57|Duke Mercator was|57|an untrustworthy man...|5A|
06CD=|5A|but he is much worse|57|than I thought.  Still, I|57|knew he'd never give us|5A|
06CE=|5A|the Gola Emerald, so|57|while you were loitering in|57|the hole, I found a new job.|5A|
06CF=|5A|I'm sure this princess will|57|carry a good price!|57|Heh heh heh...See you!|5A|
06D0=|5A|You came to save me,|57|right?  Wow, cool!  It's|57|always been my dream|5A|
06D1=|5A|to be saved by a prince!|57|Wow!  Now, get this|57|lounge lizard and save me!!|5A|
06D2=|5A|L...lizard?  I'm a|57|Drakkonian, not a lizard!|57|Anyway, off we go!|5A|
06D3=|5A|Hey!  Where are|57|you going?  Help me!|57|Save me, my prince!|5A|
06D4=|5A|Stay there!|57|Or this noisy girl will|57|fall to her death!|5A|
06D5=|5A|'Bye, Nigel!|57|it was nice meeting you!|57|Perhaps some other time!|5A|
06D6=|5A|Wow!  I'm flying!  See?|57|I'm flying!  Say!  Are you|57|licensed by the AFA?|5A|
06D7=|5A|My prince!|57|Please come save meeeee!|5A|
06D8=|5A|Ouch...!|5A|
06D9=|5A|Sir Nigel!|5A|
06DA=|5A|My lord, the duke|57|heard about the secret|57|treasures from those three|5A|
06DB=|5A|and stole away on a|57|ship...after breaking the|57|lighthouse to prevent us from|5A|
06DC=|5A|following him...Listen!|57|Go around to the east wall of|57|the castle and open the door.|5A|
06DD=|5A|There is a hidden|57|switch to open the gate to|57|Greenmaze...|5A|
06DE=|5A|The gate will appear|57|at the fountain...|57|To fix the lighthouse...|5A|
06DF=|5A|Thou must go to|57|Greenmaze and find the|57||5A|...|5A|
06E0=|5A|Go upstairs|57|and cut the armour...|5A|
06E1=|5A|Hurry!|57|Follow the duke as soon as|57|you can!  Don't let him get|5A|
06E2=|5A|the treasures!|57|He's a devil...|5A|
06E3=|5A|Nigel!|57|We're counting on thee|57|to stop the duke!...|5A|
06E4=|5A|Oh, it's you!  While I|57|was looking for the exit, I|57|happened to find this place.|5A|
06E5=|5A|W-what?!  Princess Lara|57|was kidnapped by the duke!?|57|What a wicked man!|5A|
06E6=|5A|Mr. Nigel!|57|I trust in you!|57|Please save Princess Lara!|5A|
06E7=|5A|Duke Mercator once|57|asked me about a book called|57|"A War History of King Nole".|5A|
06E8=|5A|The book had been handed|57|down for generations in the|57|Royal Family of Maple, but|5A|
06E9=|5A|the book itself no longer|57|exists.  The Princess knows|57|the contents by heart,|5A|
06EA=|5A|however, and I think|57|the duke wants to use her|57|as a key to the treasures|5A|
06EB=|5A|hidden in the book.|5A|
06EC=|5A|Please get the princess|57|back from Duke Mercator!|5A|
06ED=|5A|La-la-la,|57|we like to make people lose|57|their way in the forest!|5A|
06EE=|5A|La-la-la,|57|we like to see people walking|57|around in Greenmaze!|5A|
06EF=|5A|Hello!|57|You're lost, aren't you?|5A|
06F0=|5A|You're lost!|5A|
06F1=|5A|Ha ha! You're lost!|5A|
06F2=|5A|Look, Nigel!|57|This dog is badly hurt!|5A|
06F3=|5A|Poor dog!|57|I'll cast a spell on you|57|to make you better.  Nigel!|5A|
06F4=|5A|Give me an |5A|!|58|
06F5=|5A|Thanks!|57|It's all right, poor dog!|5A|
06F6=|5A|Good!  He looks much|57|better, now.  If only I were|57|better at using magic.|5A|
06F7=|5A|'Bye-bye!|57|Be careful!|5A|
06F8=|5A|Bow-wow-wow!|5A|
06F9=|5A|Nigel...he seems to|57|be calling us...!|57|Let's follow him!|5A|
06FA=|5A|But...he's nearly|57|dead!  Please!|58|
06FB=|5A|I hate you!!|5A|
06FC=|5A|You don't have any |5A|?|57|Quickly!  Get some and|57|hurry back so I can cure him.|5A|
06FD=|5A|Bow-wow-wow!|5A|
06FE=|5A|Thank you, Nigel and Friday.|57|You saved my dog's life.|57|He's my best friend.|5A|
06FF=|5A|Just a minute!|57|How come you know our names?|57|You might be the duke's...|5A|
0700=|5A|No, no!|57|Einstein told me.|57|Einstein is my dog.|5A|
0701=|5A|You mean to say|57|this dog can...he told|57|you our names?|5A|
0702=|5A|Yes, he did!|57|Please...take this|57|in return for your kindness.|5A|
0703=|5A|Now you can talk with any|57|dog you meet!  Why don't you|57|try it with Einstein?|5A|
0704=|5A|Really?|57|What a wonderful whistle!|57|Nigel, try it!|5A|
0705=|5A|Thanks, Nigel!|57|I was attacked|57|by savage Forest Orcs!|5A|
0706=|5A|But thanks to you,|57|I'm alive and well, now!|5A|
0707=|5A|Visit me anytime!|5A|
0708=|5A|Oh!!|57|Don't frighten me like that!|5A|
0709=|5A|The view from here is|57|splendid, huh?|57|'Bye, now!|5A|
070A=|5A|Tag!|57|You're it!!|5A|
070B=|5A|You're very lucky!|57|That's it!|5A|
070C=|5A|Woah!  That made me dizzy!|5A|
070D=|5A|Listen carefully!|57|Dne daed a si siht!|5A|
070E=|5A|Just a little further,|57|and you'll find...|59|a...|57|dead end!  Hahahah!|5A|
070F=|5A|You don't need me?|57||59|Bye-bye!|5A|
0710=|5A|You're off guard!|5A|
0711=|5A|Ha ha ha ha!|57|Try once more!|5A|
0712=|5A|Next time, I'll give|57|you something good!|5A|
0713=|5A|You've got grit!|57|...OK, I'll give you a hint!|57|Can you see a vine down there?|5A|
0714=|5A|You can take a short cut|57|if you go down there..|5A|
0715=|5A|Got it?  'Bye!|5A|
0716=|5A|You're doing very well!|57|But you're still|57|confused, aren't you?|5A|
0717=|5A|I'll give you a hint!|57|Go down here and head|57|south.  When you come to a|5A|
0718=|5A|dead end, go up the|57|invisible stairs and jump|57|down!  There you'll find...|5A|
0719=|5A|I can't see you, but|57|I'm glad to meet you.|5A|
071A=|5A|I'm having my lunch.|57|I can't see it, but it looks|57|good.  Would you like some?|5A|
071B=|5A|You're in hurry?|5A|
071C=|5A|I'll give you this.|57|I can't see it, but it|57|sure looks good.|5A|
071D=|5A|I enjoyed talking|57|with you!  I can't see you,|57|but you're still my friend.|5A|
071E=|5A|Good luck!|57|I can't see you, but|57|good luck!|5A|
071F=|5A|Nigel, look!|57|I can see something shining|57|over there! The |5A|!|5A|
0720=|5A|But we can't|57|get through those trees...|5A|
0721=|5A|No, don't give up now!|57|not when it's before|57|our very eyes!|5A|
0722=|5A|Oh, I know!|5A|
0723=|5A|Let's call Einstein here!|57|I think he knows|57|how to get there.|5A|
0724=|5A|But how?|5A|
0725=|5A|With your whistle!|57|Give it a try!|5A|
0726=|5A|Maybe we should|57|start over from the|57|very beginning...|5A|
0727=|5A|Bow-wow!|57|Nigel needs my help!|5A|
0728=|5A|How do you know?|5A|
0729=|5A|I can just make out|57|the sound of his whistle.|5A|
072A=|5A|He must be in trouble,|57|Einstein!  Can you go to him?|5A|
072B=|5A|Of course!|57|I'm a dog, remember?|57|I'll sniff him out!|5A|
072C=|5A|OK, let's go!|5A|
072D=|5A|Nigel...|57|I heard a dog barking!|57|It must be Einstein.|5A|
072E=|5A|Bow-wow!|57|Nigel!  Friday!|5A|
072F=|5A|What's the matter?|57|...Ah, these trees...?|5A|
0730=|5A|Let me help you!|57|Step back and stay there!|5A|
0731=|5A|Finished!|5A|
0732=|5A|I'm only too glad|57|to help you, Nigel!|5A|
0733=|5A|We're going back, now.|57|Please visit me anytime.|5A|
0734=|5A|Thanks!  Take care!|5A|
0735=|5A|You too, Friday!|57|'Bye!|5A|
0736=|5A|My name is Kado.|57|I was once a famous|57|swordsman.|5A|
0737=|5A|I used to work at the|57|castle, but retired.  I didn't|57|like town life.|5A|
0738=|5A|Are you a treasure|57|hunter?  Then you must need|57|a better sword than that...|5A|
0739=|5A|It has a special power.|5A|
073A=|5A|When the sword is fully|57|charged, a magic flame will|57|burn any enemy it touches!|5A|
073B=|5A|I think you can|57|appreciate the value|57|of the sword.|5A|
073C=|5A|How do you like it?|5A|
073D=|5A|There are other magic|57|swords somewhere on|57|this island.|5A|
073E=|5A|They are called|57||5A| and |5A|...|5A|
073F=|5A|Also, I don't know if it's|57|true, but there's supposed|57|to be a legendary Gaia Sword!|5A|
0740=|5A|Oh, the |5A|!|57|How did you get it?!  I can|57|fix the lighthouse with this!|5A|
0741=|5A|Yo-ho!|5A|
0742=|5A|Thanks to you,|57|the lighthouse is now|57|completely restored!|5A|
0743=|5A|I locked it up|57|so we won't have to go|57|through that again!|5A|
0744=|5A|It's all set!|57|Let's go!|5A|
0745=|5A|The town of Verla!|57|All ashore that's|57|going ashore!|5A|
0746=|5A|We still have a ways|57|to go!  'Bye, now!|5A|
0747=|5A|Everybody set?|57|let's go!|5A|
0748=|5A|The ship will soon set sail|57|for Verla!  You can get on|57|for free because you|5A|
0749=|5A|fixed the lighthouse!|57|Getting on now?|58|
074A=|5A|Get on board!|57|We're leaving soon!|5A|
074B=|5A|We have to leave now!|57|Step lively!  And, don't|57|bother the other passengers!|5A|
074C=|5A|OK, I'll|57|wait a while for you...|5A|
074D=|5A|Nigel, are you OK?|57|Are you a landlubber?|57|Don't throw up on my|5A|
074E=|5A|nice, new deck!|5A|
074F=|5A|YAAAAAAARG!!!|57|RRRAAAAARG!!!|5A|
0750=|5A|Do you want to die|57|so early?  RRAAAAAWRRR!!!|5A|
0751=|5A|They call me Slasher!...|57|...just before they DIE!|5A|
0752=|5A|I'm the manager of the|57|west tunnel Royal Guard|57|under Duke Mercator!|5A|
0753=|5A|GRAAAARRR!!!|5A|
0754=|5A|YAAAARRRR!!!|5A|
0755=|5A|You are about to die|57|at the hands of Marley!|5A|
0756=|5A|I'm the Captain of|57|the Royal Guard #3|57|under Duke Mercator!|5A|
0757=|5A|Thank you!|57|I don't know who you are, but|57|I really thank you!|5A|
0758=|5A|Are you that runt Nigel,|57|the one who's always running|57|after Duke Mercator?|5A|
0759=|5A|I'm Dex,|57|the east tunnel manager|57|of the Royal Guard #7!|5A|
075A=|5A|Duke Mercator rules!|5A|
075B=|5A|BLAAAAAARRRR!!!|57|GLAAAAARRRR!!!|5A|
075C=|5A|We have been secretly|57|digging an escape tunnel.|5A|
075D=|5A|We are experts in|57|digging, now, thanks to|57|Duke Mercator!|5A|
075E=|5A|See!|57|It will be opened soon!|5A|
075F=|5A|We were discussing|57|what kind of present to|57|get you.|5A|
0760=|5A|We found a sword in the|57|mines while we were digging.\UNUSED|57|Go to the well and take it!|5A|
0761=|5A|Hi, cutie!|57|Would you be my...|5A|
0762=|5A|....Never mind!|57|Good luck!|5A|
0763=|5A|Gee!|57|How'd you get here so early?|5A|
0764=|5A|I'll never let you win!|57|That treasure's mine!|5A|
0765=|5A|What does it say?!|57|.....got it!....|57|So long, sucker!|5A|
0766=|5A|Ouch!!!|57|Aughhhh!|5A|
0767=|5A|NOOOOO!!!|57|akkggghhh...........|5A|
0768=|5A|Mmmmm!...Bright boy brains!!|57|love to eat them up|57|everyday....yum!!|5A|
0769=|5A|Heh heh.....|5A|
076A=|5A|Rats!  Somebody,|57|tell me the way I should go!|57|We're completely lost!  Wally!|5A|
076B=|5A|This is all your fault!|57|Our precious jewel has|57|gone to the duke!!|5A|
076C=|5A|Take that!!|5A|
076D=|5A|Ooooouuch!|5A|
076E=|5A|Ha, ha, ha|5A|
076F=|5A|Find the way out!|57|Hurry!|5A|
0770=|5A|Well, hello, Nigel!|57|Are you still alive?|57|Pity.|5A|
0771=|5A|But it's the end for you!|57|You can't follow me any more!|5A|
0772=|5A|While you're there stamping|57|your foot with vexation, I'll|57|be finding the last jewel.|5A|
0773=|5A|Hah hah hah!!...|57|So long, Nigel!|5A|
0774=|5A|I'm always one step|57|ahead of you!|5A|
0775=|5A|Look, Nigel!|57|There goes the duke...!|5A|
0776=|5A|Ha ha ha!|57|The view from up there must|57|be great, huh?|5A|
0777=|5A|Can you hear me?|57|Shall I speak louder?|57|Ha ha ha!  See you!|5A|
0778=|5A|What a hateful man!|57|Nigel, let's go down and look|57|for a way to follow him.|5A|
0779=|5A|Why are you so|57|stubborn?  I guess I've|57|underestimated you!|5A|
077A=|5A|Come on, Nigel...let's have|57|at it!  It's a great honor|57|to be killed by my sword!|5A|
077B=|5A|Impossible!...|59|I-I...|59|you...|5A|
077C=|5A|Excellent, Zak!|57|Ha ha ha ha!|57|Got you, elf-boy!|5A|
077D=|5A|My duty is over!|57|You'll never make me pull|57|such a mean trick again!|5A|
077E=|5A|I despise you.|57|I'm going back home!|57|Hasta la vista!|5A|
077F=|5A|Wait!  Come back!|57|I need your...|57|\UNUSEDW-whaaa...?  What's this?|5A|
0780=|5A|Nigel!  Friday!|57|Are you OK?|57|Owt...|59|es'Eht...|59|e-Viver es'Aelp|59|.|59|.|59|.|5A|
0781=|5A|What a narrow escape!|5A|
0782=|5A|Duke Mercator always seems|57|to hold a trump card|57|up his sleeve.|5A|
0783=|5A|As you know, the duke wants|57|to conquer the whole|57|world with those treasures.|5A|
0784=|5A|Please stop him!|57|I'll be watching over you.|5A|
0785=|5A|To prove my words,|57|I'll give you a|57|helpful magic spell.|5A|
0786=|5A|You can cut the sacred trees|57|with it.  One of them is in|57|front of this tower.|5A|
0787=|5A|The duke's already got|57|the five jewels that|57|open the door to the|5A|
0788=|5A|legendary underground|57|world.  Go to the mountains|57|northwest of Mercator.|5A|
0789=|5A|You can get there|57|through the north gate|57|of the castle.|5A|
078A=|5A|Ah, good...you escaped!|57|I'm sorry about what happened|57|at the shrine.|5A|
078B=|5A|That was a job.|5A|
078C=|5A|But now my debt to the|57|duke is paid.  This is|57|just between us!|5A|
078D=|5A|It's a pleasure to|57|fight against an equal!|5A|
078E=|5A|If you want to catch up|57|with the duke, defeat me,|57|and I'll tell you where he is!|5A|
078F=|5A|Stop it!  STOP!!|5A|
0790=|5A|What's fair about this?|57|You have the advantage|57|up here!|5A|
0791=|5A|Do you have enough brains|57|to understand the meaning|57|of the word "fair"?|5A|
0792=|5A|Wha....?!|57|Fine.  Then we'll move|57|to a more "fair" situation!|5A|
0793=|5A|That plain ground to the|57|north would be just fine.|57|Come after me!|5A|
0794=|5A|Is this all right|57|with you, little sister?|57|Is this fair?|5A|
0795=|5A|Good...let's do it!|5A|
0796=|5A|You...you won!|57|I can't believe you're|57|just a kid!|5A|
0797=|5A|Here, take this!|5A|
0798=|5A|Use it in front of the|57|statue of the goddess under|57|the bridge to follow the duke.|5A|
0799=|5A|I hope to challenge you|57|again, so...|59|come back alive!|5A|
079A=|5A|Specially selected|57|goods are waiting for you!|57|Just for you!|5A|
079B=|5A|Buy now, or you'll|57|have to wait a whole month!|5A|
079C=|5A|Thank you, thank you!|57|See you again!|57|See you next month!|5A|
079D=|5A|Ah, yes!  |5A|!|5A|
079E=|5A|Do you like it?|58|
079F=|5A|I'll send it|57|directly to your shop!|5A|
07A0=|5A|What makes you hesitate!?|5A|
07A1=|5A|No kidding!|5A|
07A2=Nigel held up |5A|!|5A|
07A3=|5A|You again!|5A|
07A4=|5A|I think it's time|57|to stop playing tag with you!|57|Come here!|5A|
07A5=|5A|Ha ha ha!|57|Look!|5A|
07A6=|5A|These beautiful jewels|57|will lead me to...|57||59|...the treasures!|5A|
07A7=|5A|Princess Lara!|57|Sing the song you learned|57|in your childhood,|5A|
07A8=|5A|or I'll bust you in the head!|5A|
07A9=|5A|N-no!  No, no!  No!|57|I'll never sing it for you!|57|I would rather die!|5A|
07AA=|5A|Good.|57|I didn't think you were|57|afraid of death.|5A|
07AB=|5A|How about this- sing|57|the song, or I'll put a|57|frog in your dress!|5A|
07AC=|5A|Eeeeeeeee!|57|Noooooooooooo!|5A|
07AD=|5A|...O-OK...|57|you...win...!|5A|
07AE=|5A|Oh, guardian|59| of the|57|darkness...|59|When the five|57|stones gather|59| here...|5A|
07AF=|5A|show to me...the|57|secret passage!|57||59|In-nah|59| Gad'da|59| da|59| V'idda!|5A|
07B0=|5A|Ha ha ha ha!|57|The legendary treasures will|57|be mine!  Ha ha ha ha!|5A|
07B1=|5A|Oh, my prince!|57|I just knew you'd|57|come to save me...!|5A|
07B2=|5A|You are my prince!|57|Oh, it's just like a fairy tale|57|come true!|5A|
07B3=|5A|Ever since the duke|57|trapped me in that|57|castle tower, I've been|5A|
07B4=|5A|dreaming of the day you'd|57|come to save me!|57|Oh, my prince!|5A|
07B5=|5A|I'm so happy!!|57|You're so much cuter|57|than I expected!|5A|
07B6=|5A|But...what's this?|57|Oh, my prince!  You're|57|wounded!  Bad germs could|5A|
07B7=|5A|enter your body!|57|The germs would cause a|57|serious disease!  The disease|5A|
07B8=|5A|would kill my prince!|5A|
07B9=|5A|Put a lid on it, sister!|57|And quit calling him|57|"my prince"!!|5A|
07BA=|5A|His name is Nigel!|57|He didn't mean to save you!|5A|
07BB=|5A|It just happened!|57|Do you understand?|5A|
07BC=|5A|How dare you!|57|I wasn't speaking to you,|57|you pint-sized brat!|5A|
07BD=|5A|That's it!!  I've had it|57|with you!  Take that!|57|And that!  And that!|5A|
07BE=|5A|Ouch!  Ouch!|5A|
07BF=|5A|Stay out of this, Moralis!|57|I can handle this mini-witch|57|by myself!|5A|
07C0=|5A|Princess!!|57|Mr. Nigel and Miss Friday|57|saved your life!|5A|
07C1=|5A|...|59|yeah|59|...I'm sorry...|57|but...|59|but...|59|I was so scared!...|5A|
07C2=|5A|...sob...|57|every day I dropped something|57|down from the tower, but|5A|
07C3=|5A|nobody came!|57|Nobody noticed a thing!|57|...I was scared!|5A|
07C4=|5A|...OK, OK...|57|Let's go back home,|57|Princess Lara.|5A|
07C5=|5A|...Boo, hoo, hoo!...|5A|
07C6=|5A|Mr. Nigel!|57|Thank you very much for all|57|of your kindness!|5A|
07C7=|5A|If you ever come to the|57|continent, please visit Maple!|5A|
07C8=|5A|Poor girl...|57|I think she must've cracked|57|being alone in that|5A|
07C9=|5A|tower for so long...|57|Imagine her calling you|57|"my prince!"  The nerve!|5A|
07CA=|5A|Anyway...let's go!|57|We have to catch up with|57|Duke Mercator!|5A|
07CB=|5A|Run away!  Hurry!|57|She'll change you|57|into a dog!|5A|
07CC=|5A|Heh heh heh!|57|Too late!|57|You are now....\UNUSEDa dog!|5A|
07CD=|5A|Hee hee hee...|57|So.  You finally made it!...|5A|
07CE=|5A|I don't know why, but|57|you seem to be fatal to me.|57|I think you'd better|5A|
07CF=|5A|DIE now!|57|Hee hee hee...|57|Can't move, can you?  Ha!|5A|
07D0=|5A|Ha ha ha!...|57|Your life will come to an end|57|when I press this switch...|5A|
07D1=|5A|...let's see, now...|57|which switch is it...?|57|Maybe...\UNUSEDTHIS one!|5A|
07D2=|5A|Aauugh!|57|I made a mistake!|5A|
07D3=|5A|What a wigged-out witch!|57|Now, let's go!|5A|
07D4=|5A|Moooaaann...|57|Grooooaaann...ooooaaannn...|5A|
07D5=|5A|Groooaaann...|57|Ohhh, ouch!!|57|Help me...!|5A|
07D6=|5A|Something is running|57|around in my body!|57|Please help me!|5A|
07D7=|5A|Hello!  Me?  Oh, I'm|57|fine, now.  Are my|57|children helpful to you?|5A|
07D8=|5A|Wow!  No more pain!|57|Say...that feels good!|5A|
07D9=|5A|I don't know who you|57|are, but I really want to|57|thank you!|5A|
07DA=|5A|Listen!  I have many pairs|57|of kids born as twins.|57|Each is connected to a|5A|
07DB=|5A|corresponding one.  You can|57|teleport from one to the other|57|if you find them both.|5A|
07DC=|5A|I'll tell my kids|57|to help you.|57|Take care of yourself!|5A|
07DD=|5A|Ho, ho...It's me!|57|I came down here to look|57|for something nice, but|5A|
07DE=|5A|I don't think there's|57|anything here for me...|57|'Bye!|5A|
07DF=|5A|Heh heh heh!|57|Here's your money for the|57||5A|.
07E0=Nigel got 2000 golds!
07E1=|5A|You're a very good|57|treasure hunter...heh heh heh.
07E2=|5A|With that money, you|57|won't have to work for|57|quite some time.  I envy you!
07E3=|5A|Wh...what?!
07E4=|5A|Help me, please!
07E5=|5A|Who are you?
07E6=|5A|Hey, you!|57|Hand me that little girl!
07E7=|5A|...girl.
07E8=|5A|...girl.
07E9=|5A|They know I've seen|57|King Nole's treasures!|59||59||59|
07EA=|5A|They'll do anything to|57|make me talk!
07EB=|5A|They'll probably even|57|kill me!  Who knows!|57|So, please...help me!!
07EC=|5A|Wait a minute!|57|Did you say|57|"King Nole's treasures?"
07ED=|5A|What's with all the|57|jibber-jabber!?  I told you|57|to give me that girl!
07EE=|5A|Run!  Hurry!!
07EF=|5A|Hmmm...could be|57|interesting!  OK, c'mon!
07F0=|5A|Hahahahahaha!|57|You won't get away....
07F1=|5A|We did it!|57|She's gone!
07F2=|5A|Hey, girl!|57|Did you really see|57|the legendary treasures?
07F3=|5A|The name's Friday!|57|Don't call me "girl"!
07F4=|5A|OK, ok...and you can|57|call me Nigel.  Now, talk!|57|I saved your life, you know.
07F5=|5A|To tell the truth,|57|I didn't really...
07F6=|5A|Quit fooling!|59||59||59|
07F7=|5A|Why were they running|57|after you if you hadn't|57|seen the treasures?
07F8=|5A|Well, I didn't actually|57|SEE them, but I know they're|57|around here somewhere...
07F9=|5A|Great!|57|Take me to the general|57|area...
07FA=|5A|After that, my|57|keen senses will|57|lead us to the treasures.
07FB=|5A|All right, then!|57|Follow me, Nigel!
07FC=|5A|Let's get one thing|57|straight--I'm not your|57|follower!

07FF=|5A|I paid all my money|57|to that strange big bird!
0800=|5A|But, the ship going|57|to the island only comes|57|once a month!
0801=|5A|You said, "I don't|57|care how much it costs.  I|57|wanna go there right now!"
0802=|5A|...but, 2000 golds!|57|that's more than I.....
0803=|5A|The treasure's|57|worth more than|57|2000 golds, isn't it?

0825=|5A|You met my father, right?|57|In that case, go on up and|57|cut the tree to make a raft!|5A|
0826=|5A|I wish we could grow|57|more trees underground...|5A|

084D=|5A|Do you remember that|57|terrible war with King Nole?|5A|
084E=|5A|Wasn't that|57|the worst experience?|5A|
084F=|5A|What?  YOU'RE|57|looking for the treasures|57|of King Nole?|5A|
0850=|5A|Be careful!|57|He's dead, but...|5A|
0851=|5A|he would surely rise|57|from the grave to protect|57|his treasures...|5A|
0852=|5A|Your boyfriend|57|is cute, huh?|5A|
0853=|5A|Friday, it's you!|57|Well, you're with a|57|boy as usual.|5A|

0872=|5A|What is it?|57|Did you find a special weapon?
0873=|5A|No, silly!|57|It's much more|57|valuable than that!

0877=|5A|You know, I can't help|57|feeling...|59||59|
0878=|5A|Maybe it's time I|57|explored the continent|57|for more treasures...|59|
0879=|5A|...I...|59|I...|59||57|I hate you!  I HATE you!|57|You'll be beaten and
